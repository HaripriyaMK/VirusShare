# VirusShare

The purpose of this repository it's to provide a dataset of static data extracted from the VirusShare malware repository.

In case you find this information useful, please spread the word to have more people using this data.

I'll be adding the output for the different tools we have available in the community in order to have this data available for if someday is needed to use them in an academic way.

Special thanks to J-Michael Roberts to create and maintain VirusShare free of charge for the community
