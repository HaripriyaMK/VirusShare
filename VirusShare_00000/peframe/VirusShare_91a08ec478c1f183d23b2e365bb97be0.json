Useful case studies include AT&T, Bell Atlantic, EDS, JC Penney, Rockwell, Silicon Graphics, Inc., Texas Instruments, Turner Broadcasting, etc. We're impressed with the detail of the case studies given corporations' general reluctance to reveal their internal network structures; they all really nail down the value of the book. We find this book appealing to managers and higher-level integrators who don't want to be overwhelmed with technical minutia but need to focus on feasibility, organizational, and cost-benefit aspects of implementing new technology.
