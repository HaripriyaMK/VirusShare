The rumor, which was started by a small\ntechnology enthusiast Web site, had Microsoft changing the product keys for\nall of its customers using volume licensing.

We are not issuing volume licensing customers new product keys. Volume\nlicensing customers are not impacted by any of the changes we are making to\nactivation in SP1. The only folks impacted by the changes we are making in\nSP1 are people with illegal copies of Windows.\"\n<p>\nAs I first reported back in May, the Windows Product Activation feature in\nXP SP1 will get two minor modifications, neither of which will affect any\nlegitimate users. First, Microsoft discovered that the majority of pirated\nXP copies out there are tied to single volume license product key. So\nMicrosoft alerted the company about the problem, changed their key, and\ndisabled it for use after SP1. So anyone using this pirated key will be\nunable to upgrade to SP1 or any future updates via Windows Update. Also,\nMicrosoft is adding a three-day grace period for people that use the same\nproduct key to install XP on two different systems; in the past, there was\nno grace period and the user had to immediately activation via phone in\norder to use XP on the second system. This will give users some breathing\nroom if disaster strikes and you have to install XP on a new system.\n</body></html>"
