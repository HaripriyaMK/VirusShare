Beeps are shortened and melodies are reduced to                one short beep followed by a series of clicks.  Some sound effects using        very short duration tones may still sound.  The program functions by            intercepting the system clock tick interrupt.  Once installed (by entering      the command SILENCE), at every tick (18.2 times a second) the speaker is        turned off and timer 2 is set to produce a single click.  The program can       be turned ON (no sound) or OFF (sounds allowed) through the commands            SILENCE ON and SILENCE OFF.  Communication with the installed program           (to turn it ON and OFF) is accomplished through use of the unformatted          data area of the program segment prefix of the installed program.  This         communication can be disrupted by other programs which intercept the            system clock tick (such as a printer spooler).  If communication is not         possible the user is notified.  SILENCE should be compatible with most          programs.  If interference is caused by another resident program, try           switching the order in which the programs are installed.

As Silence                    is a resident addition to DOS, available memory will be                         decreased by the size of the program (300 bytes).  SILENCE                      checks during installation to see if the resident portion has                   already been installed.  If it has, or if another resident                      program exists which may interfere with the operation of                        SILENCE, the user is given the option to abort or continue                      with the installation.                                                                                                                                          Installing more than one copy of SILENCE serves no useful                       purpose.  Every copy installed consumes 300 bytes of memory,                    increases clock tick interrupt service overhead, and                            causes the setting of all but the last copy installed to be                     fixed (it can no longer be changed from ON to OFF or OFF to                     ON).
