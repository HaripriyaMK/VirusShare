            "Capt. Mike Hennessy caught his first striped marlin with his Dad in Cabo San Lucas at the age of 10.  Catching that fish shaped his destiny and marlin fever was in his blood.  Soon after he was charter fishing in Newport Beach, California on half day and full day boats.  His love for fishing and the pursuit of the big fish grew while he was a teenager.  But the draw to find the slobs had him on a plane to Hawaii.  He started exploring the waters outside of Kewalo Basin on Oahu.  And at 19 years old earned his 100 ton masters license, competing with seasoned peers and of course the fish scales.  Since then he has been following his dream to catch the biggest and best fish and experiences around the world. ",
            "Always looking for adventure and to broaden his fishing knowledge Hennessy headed down to Central America to the southern zone of Costa Rica in 1995.  For 12 years, he led Cabo Matapalo Sportfishing on a 28ft Carolina Classic they released hundreds of big blue and black marlin and thousands of sailfish taking home some of the areas top tournament trophies.  ",
            "His pursuit of his passion has taken him to 5 continents to track down the biggest and best fish.  While Mike only speaks English and Spanish, he has interpreted the fishing waters around the worldfrom fly fishing in Slovenia, to sailfishing in Indonesia.  Every October he is recruited to Cabo San Lucas to try his luck at the famed Black and Blue Bisbees million dollar jackpot which he won in 2010.  Hennessy is a worldwide fishing advneture specialist in fresh water and saltwater species from leopard rainbow trout to grander marlin. ",
            "Captain Mike is now based in Hawaii where he guides for trophy bonefish with his company Hawaii On The Fly.  His custom 16 Action Craft kevlar flats boat is the key to his success by providing access to remote flats and reefs.  Hennessy is also working with the Oio Tagging Program to gather vital information of the life cycles and movements of the resident bonefish populations and help with sustainable mananagment of the islands marine resources.  In addition, he still stalks blue marlin and yellow fin tuna, hoping to catch that double grander.  I love to put my clients onto the best spot at the prime time to make the eperience successful and the memories beyond expectation, Mike explains.  ",
            "He is forever grateful to this dad, Jim Hennessy, for that first striped marlin and teaching him the fishing and sportsman lifestyle. ",
            "Capt. Mike Hennessy  Lives in Lanikai, Hawaii with his wife Katie and daughter Brisa.  He has a 100 Ton USCG Captains License and is an IGFA Certified Captain.  He has been featured on the Outdoor Channel and many publications including, Center Console, Saltwater, and Marlin.",
