It was \n\t\tbeginning to get hot and our walkers were getting thin and trim. Once \n\t\tagain we take to the roads of America to cross this Continent in search \n\t\tof sacred sites needing to be protected and secured for the next \n\t\tgeneration - in fact for the next Seven Generations. We walk this<br>\n\t\tland to listen to the people and hear their concerns about this Planet \n\t\twe call mother Earth.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">We walk to remind America \n\t\tthat this is still Indian Land, that we are very concerned about the \n\t\tmistreatment and contamination of the Air, the Water and the Soil. When \n\t\tthe Great Spirit asked us to care for the land we accepted this task and \n\t\tduty. It is a committed duty with many responsibilities; within these \n\t\tduties are found the many Spiritual ceremonies that govern our way of \n\t\tlife. These ceremonies<br>\n\t\tare conducted daily, weekly, monthly, seasonly, and yearly.<br>\n&nbsp;</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In preparation we look for \n\t\tmedicinal plants, herbs, and roots that accompany our ceremonies and \n\t\tsongs. Now with this climate change we fear many of the herbs, roots and \n\t\tplants will be lost because of the warming of Mother Earth and of \n\t\tmankind's destructive policies. </font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In California, we have \n\t\twalked this land thru Rumsey Band of the Wintun Tribe, Yokuts, Santa \n\t\tRosa Rancheria and the Mojave People at Fort Mohave. In Arizona, we \n\t\twalked through the Haulapai, Havasupai,<br>\n\t\tYavapai-Apache and Din\ufffd Territories. In New Mexico, we walked through \n\t\tthe pueblo lands of the Ohkay Owingeh and are about to enter the Taos \n\t\tpueblo territory. Community after community the people welcomed us and \n\t\tfed us. they opened up their homes and shared many tribal stories with \n\t\tus. They showed us family pictures of son and daughters graduating from<br>\n\t\tschools. We saw many photos of men and women in uniform. We became \n\t\textended families to each other. Then they began to tell us of \n\t\tenvironmental concerns - what we heard is very troubling.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">At this hour we are \n\t\tcompiling a \ufffdManifesto for Change.\ufffd This Work will<br>\n\t\treflect our findings, suggestions, and Articles for change to members of \n\t\tthe<br>\n\t\tUnited States Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. As we \n\t\tprogress on this Document we realize that many Tribal Nations have not \n\t\thad an opportunity share with us their concerns.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">We now wish to invite all \n\t\ttribal members and nations from Turtle Island to<br>\n\t\tsend, write, email any concerns of the environment in your area or of \n\t\tany outstanding congressional action which may have deprived you of<br>\n\t\tancestral lands, water or human rights. We shall include them in our \n\t\tManifesto. We will walk into Washington, D.C. united with the Northern \n\t\tRoute, Michigan running team, many delegations from the Southwest will<br>\n\t\tjoin us as we walk into D.C. on July 11, 2008. Please note we have less \n\t\tthan 90 days before we reach D.C. We are planning the \ufffdCultural Survival \n\t\tSummit\ufffd for July 8, 9 and 10, 2008. Should you wish to participate in \n\t\tthis historic event, please register online at our website - you will be \n\t\tcontacted<br>\n\t\tby the Cultural Survival Summit planning committee. Cultural Survival<br>\n\t\tSummit details will be posted on our website in the coming days. We \n\t\tinvite indigenous leaders from around the world to bring a delegation to \n\t\tjoin us at the Summit and walk into DC with us; We invite Indigenous \n\t\tmusicians, drum groups, dancers, singers, and performers to join us; We \n\t\tinvite the Youth of our Nations to join us; We invite the Elders of our \n\t\tNations to<br>\n\t\tjoin us; We invite Native organizations to join us; We invite Tribal \n\t\tdelegations to join us; We invite brothers and sisters from all cultural \n\t\tbackgrounds to join us. </font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">As we walk these final 90 \n\t\tdays, I will make every attempt to update you at least once a week from \n\t\tthis day forward. 30 years ago we did make some changes by walking \n\t\tacross this country - now let's make more changes.

These \n\t\tmisrepresentations come from various sources: citizens who are simply \n\t\tunlearned in Cherokee history, politicians who tend to rewrite Cherokee \n\t\thistory to serve their own purposes and out-and-out racists.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">No matter who causes the \n\t\tmisunderstanding or makes misstatements, all<br>\n\t\tpromote a distortion of the historical facts, which must be clarified if<br>\n\t\tCherokee citizens are to make informed decisions. It is time for them \n\t\tnot only to face the facts, but honestly to re-evaluate their positions \n\t\tin light of them. Because so much attention focuses on the work of the \n\t\tDawes Commission and the Dawes rolls, they should consider the \n\t\tbackground for making Cherokee rolls and what the Dawes Commission did.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The argument that the \n\t\tFreedmen never had full citizenship rights in the<br>\n\t\tCN prior to the Dawes period is spurious. In 1866, for the first time, \n\t\tthe<br>\n\t\tFreedmen gained the first citizenship they had ever held. It was the \n\t\tonly citizenship they would have until 1901, when the United States made \n\t\tall of the citizens of the CN citizens of the United States as well. The \n\t\tFreedmen's rights in the Cherokee Nation were guaranteed by the Treaty \n\t\tof 1866, which the CN signed and carried out. It did so admirably, \n\t\tconsidering the racial climate in the adjoining states at the time.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Following the Treaty in \n\t\t1866, the Cherokee National Council amended the<br>\n\t\tconstitution to guarantee the freedmen full rights as citizens. The \n\t\tNation's own citizenship court and Supreme Court subsequently admitted \n\t\tlarge numbers of additional Freedmen applicants to citizenship. These \n\t\twere primarily Freedmen who had not returned to the CN within the \n\t\tsix-month limit set by the treaty. A good example was the Supreme \n\t\tCourt's action on June 21, 1871, which &quot;admitted to Cherokee Rights and \n\t\tCitizenship&quot; 34 Cherokee Freedman households. Without doubt, the court \n\t\trealized the<br>\n\t\timplications of its action: not only those admitted but their hundreds \n\t\tof descendants would be future citizens of the Nation. This was only one \n\t\tof a number of such decisions.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In taking its censuses, the \n\t\tCN listed citizens according to the basis for their<br>\n\t\trights to citizenship: by blood or by adoption. In the latter category, \n\t\tthey listed four groups: Shawnees, Delawares, Freedmen, and intermarried \n\t\twhites. No matter what category a person was in, he or she was still a \n\t\tcitizen of the CN.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">If the CN did not want the \n\t\tFreedmen as citizens or did not recognize them,<br>\n\t\twhy did it, year after year for decades, guarantee their rights by law; \n\t\twillfully admit more of them to citizenship and consistently list them \n\t\tas citizens of the Nation while at the same time keeping separate lists \n\t\tof intruders or people who had doubtful status as citizens? The Cherokee \n\t\tNation was, in fact, a multiracial, multi-cultural constitutional \n\t\tnation, whose citizenship was based not on blood or culture but on \n\t\teither birth<br>\n\t\tor adoption.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The freedmen also \n\t\tparticipated in the economic, social and political life of the CN. Like \n\t\tother citizens, they had access to land under the improvement laws that \n\t\tguaranteed Cherokee citizens the right to occupy as much of the public \n\t\tdomain as they could improve so long as their improvements were at least \n\t\tone-quarter of a mile from the next citizen's. Like other citizens, they \n\t\thad elementary schools and a high school, built and supported by the CN. \n\t\tLike other citizens, they were subject to the courts of the CN. In \n\t\tcontrast, those black, white and Indian residents in the Nation who were \n\t\tnot citizens had none of these rights and privileges and were subject to \n\t\tthe United States court at Fort Smith.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">When a Senate investigating \n\t\tcommittee visited the CN in 1878, the senators<br>\n\t\tinterviewed Freedman Jesse Ross among others. In response to their \n\t\tquestions, Ross testified that the Freedmen had the same rights as other \n\t\tCherokee citizens: access to as much land as they needed, schools, right \n\t\tto sit on juries and the right to vote. Ross's testimony makes clear \n\t\tthat Freedmen participated in the political process.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In 2003, the press quoted \n\t\tthe late Julian Fite as saying that the Freedmen<br>\n\t\thad never voted in the CN. Whether Fite made the statement or not, the \n\t\tcontrary was true. Like other Cherokee citizens, they voted and ran for \n\t\tpolitical office. Cherokee historian Emmett Starr lists six who were \n\t\telected and served in the National Council: Joseph Brown, Stick Ross, \n\t\tNed Irons, Frank Vann, Samuel Stidham and Jerry Alberty. There were \n\t\tprobably more. The historical record shows that numerous others from \n\t\tvarious districts were nominated and ran for office under the banner of \n\t\tone of the two major political parties. A cursory reading of the \n\t\tCherokee Advocate and other<br>\n\t\tpapers from the Nation in the late 19th century shows that Freedmen \n\t\tvoters<br>\n\t\twere main players in every election. Cherokee political cartoonist Roger<br>\n\t\tEubanks even made political hay out of those politicians who courted the<br>\n\t\tFreedman vote. If the Freedmen could not vote, how could they run for \n\t\tpolitical office and be elected?</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Contrary to what some \n\t\tpeople say, in the Dawes period the citizenship of the Freedmen in the \n\t\tCN was not questioned. The argument that the Dawes<br>\n\t\tCommission somehow &quot;palmed&quot; the Freedmen off on the Cherokee Nation is a \n\t\tdistortion of the historical record. So is the idea that blood quantum \n\t\ton the Cherokees by-blood roll had some special meaning in determining \n\t\texclusive citizenship in the Nation.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The CN's agreement with the \n\t\tDawes Commission was ratified by the<br>\n\t\tCherokee electorate - including the freedmen - on Aug. 7, 1902. \n\t\tRegarding<br>\n\t\tthe making of rolls it stated, &quot;The roll of citizens of the Cherokee \n\t\tNation shall be made as of September first, nineteen hundred and two, \n\t\tand the names of all persons then living and entitled to enrollment on \n\t\tthat date shall be placed on said roll by the Commission to the Five \n\t\tCivilized Tribes.&quot; It did not say &quot;citizens by blood&quot; or &quot;citizens and \n\t\tFreedmen&quot; or &quot;citizens and others.&quot;</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The roll that the Dawes \n\t\tCommission made was a roll of Cherokee citizens<br>\n\t\taccording to the means by which they acquired citizenship: by blood or \n\t\tby<br>\n\t\tadoption.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The Dawes Commission had \n\t\tactually begun enrolling Cherokee citizens in<br>\n\t\t1896, at which time and thereafter the CN insisted that the Commission \n\t\tuse the CN's own authenticated roll of 1880 as the base roll for \n\t\tenrollment. The 1880 authenticated roll listed five categories of \n\t\tcitizens according to the means by which they acquired citizenship: \n\t\tCherokees by blood, adopted Shawnees, adopted Delawares, adopted Colored \n\t\tand adopted Whites. The Dawes Commission simply followed the CN's \n\t\tdirections in making what became the final roll of citizens. Thus as of \n\t\tSept. 1, 1902, the Freedmen were citizens of the CN, according to the CN \n\t\tand the Dawes Commission. In the last elections held in the Nation \n\t\tbefore 1906, the Cherokee Freedmen, like other citizens of the nation, \n\t\tvoted for the offices of chief and<br>\n\t\tnational council, just as they had done in decades past. The form the \n\t\tDawes roll took made no change in their status.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Much is made of the blood \n\t\tquantum - or lack of it - listed on the Dawes rolls. Blood quantum was a \n\t\tmethod devised by Indian policy makers, such as the Dawes Commission, to \n\t\tlay the groundwork for separating the citizens of Indian nations from \n\t\ttheir assets. It was rooted in the virulent racism of the late 19th \n\t\tcentury, which said that the whiter one was, the more civilized he was. \n\t\tBy the time of Cherokee enrollment, the theory was commonly accepted. It \n\t\tlaid the basis for restrictions on the sale, or alienation, of homestead \n\t\tallotments. The idea was that those who were more than<br>\n\t\thalf Cherokee were incompetent to manage their own affairs and would \n\t\ttherefore become wards of the Department of the Interior.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">In recent years, full blood \n\t\thas held a premium value. Cherokee family stories commonly tell how an \n\t\tancestor on the Dawes roll is listed as half blood when he or she was \n\t\treally full. Most of those stories are probably true. Knowing that they \n\t\twould likely be labeled incompetent, many Cherokees probably chose \n\t\tvoluntarily to lower their blood quantum.</font></p>\n\t\t<p>Subsequent historical events suggest that the Dawes Commission could \n\t\talso<br>\n\t\thave had a motive to do so. Congress's primary purpose in creating the<br>\n\t\tCommission was to guarantee the transfer of land from the common \n\t\tCherokeeNational title to individual ownership. That was a preliminary \n\t\tstep to the ultimate goal: to transfer the land from Cherokee hands to \n\t\tthe hands of &quot;real&quot; American settlers, as whites were generally called \n\t\tby the politicians of the day. The blood quantum designation had no \n\t\tuseful purpose in determining who was a Cherokee citizen or who received<br>\n\t\tan allotment. It was simply a device to determine which Cherokee \n\t\tcitizens<br>\n\t\twould become the first marks for American land buyers and which citizens<br>\n\t\twould become wards of the Interior Department, which would manage \n\t\twhatever resources might be on or below the surface of their allotments. \n\t\tBy the time the Cherokee Nation-Dawes agreement was drawn up, there was \n\t\ta public clamor for removal of restrictions on the sale of allotments in \n\t\tIndian Territory. In 1904, only two years after the agreement, \n\t\trestrictions were removed from the allotments of Freedmen and \n\t\tintermarried whites. The next land to go in the CN was allotments of \n\t\tCherokees listed as half blood or less, from whose allotments the \n\t\trestrictions were soon removed.</p>\n\t\t<p>Removal of restrictions did not affect the citizenship of the \n\t\tallottee. When the Five Tribes Act was passed in 1906, it applied as \n\t\tmuch to the Cherokee<br>\n\t\tFreedmen as it did to the adopted Shawnees, adopted Delawares, \n\t\tintermarried Whites and Cherokees by blood. If the &quot;full force and \n\t\teffect&quot; clause of the act has validity for Cherokee descendants today, \n\t\tit has validity for descendants of the four other classes of Cherokee \n\t\tcitizens in 1906. If the CN rejects the descendants of the Cherokee \n\t\tFreedmen without simultaneously rejecting the descendants of the adopted \n\t\tShawnees, adopted Delawares, and intermarried whites, it will be guilty \n\t\tof attempting to legalize racism, for all were equal participants in the \n\t\tCN according to the Dawes rolls of citizens.</p>\n\t\t<p>It is only through a knowledge and understanding of Cherokee history \n\t\tthat a<br>\n\t\tresolution of the impasse now facing the CN can be bridged. Nothing is \n\t\tto be gained from a repudiation of that history without giving it a \n\t\thearing. Could all of the Cherokee leaders who averred the Freedmen's \n\t\tright to citizenship from 1866 to 1906 have been wrong? Both sides must \n\t\tbecome as informed as possible and must raise public awareness and \n\t\tunderstanding of the subject. Sadly, court decisions are rarely about \n\t\tmorality or right or justice. They are about what words mean. As the \n\t\tFreedmen mark the<br>\n\t\t140th year of their citizenship in the CN, it behooves everyone to \n\t\tseriously<br>\n\t\tconsider the words of the historical records.</p>\n\t\t<p>Dan Littlefield is the director of the Sequoyah Research Center, \n\t\twhich houses the American Native Press Archives, at the University of \n\t\tArkansas at Little Rock.

He<br>\n\t\thas the power \ufffd under San Diego's &quot;strong mayor&quot; system \ufffd to launch a \n\t\tfull<br>\n\t\tinvestigation into the false pretenses Blackwater used to obtain a \n\t\t&quot;vocational trade school&quot; permit for their facility in Otay Mesa.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Dear Mayor Sanders,<br>\n\t\tWe, the undersigned, request that you use your full array of powers as \n\t\tthe<br>\n\t\tMayor of San Diego to launch an extensive investigation into the \n\t\tquestionable process by which Blackwater obtained a permit to establish \n\t\ta &quot;training facility&quot; in Otay Mesa.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">When the citizens of \n\t\tPotrero nixed lack water's plans to build a base in East County, we \n\t\tthought that Blackwater was out of San Diego for good. But now we've \n\t\tdiscovered that Blackwater obtained a permit under the &quot;Raven \n\t\tDevelopment Group&quot; (a Blackwater subsidiary) to build a new base of \n\t\toperations just three blocks from the Mexican border. In addition, the \n\t\tname on design plans reviewed by the city was &quot;Southwest Law \n\t\tEnforcement,&quot; not Blackwater USA.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">The facility has been \n\t\tpermitted as a &quot;vocational training school,&quot; but<br>\n\t\tBlackwater spokespeople admit that the facility won't be open to the \n\t\tpublic and will be used exclusively to train Navy personnel in military \n\t\ttactics. That's not a vocational school, and it calls into question \n\t\tevery other aspect of this facility.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">This isn't the first time \n\t\tthat Blackwater has tried to hold itself above<br>\n\t\tthe law, and it probably won't be the last. As ABC News recently \n\t\treported,<br>\n\t\t&quot;Blackwater has been accused of tax fraud, improper use of force, arms \n\t\ttrafficking and overbilling connected to its work for the U.S. \n\t\tgovernment in Iraq. A grand jury, federal prosecutors and congressional \n\t\tinvestigators are all currently probing allegations against the company.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">This isn't how San Diego \n\t\tshould operate. The people of Potrero spoke out<br>\n\t\tloud and clear that San Diego County doesn't want Blackwater in our \n\t\tcommunity. That's still true. While the City Council has taken steps to \n\t\toppose Blackwater's latest attempt to force itself into San Diego, you \n\t\tmust do your part and take a stand against Blackwater's continued \n\t\tattempts to skirt the law. Please review Blackwater's questionable \n\t\tpermit before these dangerous mercenaries establish a presence on our \n\t\tborder<br>\n\t\twith Mexico.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">San Diego's government has \n\t\texperienced its struggles in recent years, but<br>\n\t\tyou promised to turn things around. That means following the law and not<br>\n\t\tallowing friends of the Bush Administration special privileges when they \n\t\twant to set up shop in America's Finest City.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Members of the City Council \n\t\thave spoken out and vowed to do what they<br>\n\t\tcan to shed light on this process, but it's ultimately up to you, Mayor \n\t\tSanders.

Judge McCurrine has ordered that the \n\t\tparties reach an agreement within the next 60 days, and if the tribe and \n\t\tstate fail to reach agreement each side will submit their best offer to \n\t\ta court-appointed mediator. The mediator will choose the offer that most \n\t\tclosely conforms to the court\ufffds findings and IGRA.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffd \ufffdBad faith\ufffd has haunted California \n\t\ttribal negotiations with the state since 1991 under then-Governor Pete \n\t\tWilson, who refused to negotiate regardless of federal mandates. Until \n\t\tthis decision, the courts have not enforced it, and not until this case \n\t\thas the benchmark been established for fair and legally negotiated fees \n\t\tversus an illegal tax on tribal gaming revenues.\ufffd</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">Mazzetti emphasized that the Rincon \n\t\tTribal Council is looking forward to working with the governor\ufffds office \n\t\tin the next 60 days to produce a compact that complies with federal law, \n\t\tprovides for local mitigations, participates in the public safety and \n\t\tenvironmental concerns of neighbors, and continues to support an \n\t\timproved quality of life in all of California\ufffds tribal communities.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffdThis case means a great deal, not \n\t\tjust to Rincon, but all tribes because it confirms one of the basic \n\t\tfoundations between American Indian tribes and states: Indian tribes are \n\t\tsovereign governments, which, like other governments, may not be taxed.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><b><font face=\"Arial\">Rincon v. Schwarzenegger</font></b></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">The judge makes it clear that federal \n\t\tlaw, specifically IGRA, prevents states from using compact negotiations \n\t\tto assess a tax on tribal government gaming revenues,\ufffd he added. In his \n\t\tApril 29, 2008 decision, Judge McCurrine points out that tribal \n\t\tgovernment gaming was meant to benefit tribal governments and aid tribal \n\t\teconomic development, not to balance state budgets. \ufffdCompact \n\t\tnegotiations,\ufffd he reminded the state, \ufffdare between equal sovereigns and \n\t\tfees paid under the terms of a Tribal-State Compact are only to be used \n\t\tto mitigate impacts, protect public safety and to establish a framework \n\t\tof the regulation of gaming with the tribes.\ufffd</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">The level of taxation that the state \n\t\twas demanding to amend their compact would have amounted to 79 percent \n\t\tof the Harrah\ufffds Rincon Casino profits.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffdThat\ufffds not right and it\ufffds not fair. \n\t\tNo taxpayer would stand to have over two thirds of their income taken by \n\t\tthe state. There would be a Sacramento Tea Party,\ufffd said Mazzetti, \n\t\tadding, \ufffdThroughout history,<br>\n\t\tsome people have had the opinion that fair doesn\ufffdt apply to tribes.<br>\n\t\tHowever, Rincon has honored its agreement with the state and is willing \n\t\tto pay our fair share, but we have opposed revenue sharing that exceeds \n\t\twhat is allowed under federal law or that goes<br>\n\t\tfor impermissible purposes.\ufffd</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">Rincon\ufffds immediate goal remains to \n\t\tadd 400 machines to the existing 1600 gaming devices to reach the 2,000 \n\t\tmaximum promised in the 1999 Tribal State Compact. The tribe has \n\t\trepeatedly refused to accept a compact that does not respect the mutual \n\t\tagreements and terms of the promised 2,000-machine allowance. \ufffdThe 1999 \n\t\tcompact is a legal document. It\ufffds still binding and cannot be swept \n\t\tunder the Sacramento carpet because the state\ufffds fiscal circumstances \n\t\thave changed,\ufffd explained Mazzetti.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffdAdditionally, Rincon recognizes that \n\t\tto add machines beyond the 2,000 limit will require new terms, but terms \n\t\tthat meet the requirements of IGRA and good faith negotiations.\ufffd</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffdHow many times, and in how many ways \n\t\tmust tribes prove that we are governments before people hear and respect \n\t\twhat this means? How often must we spend our precious resources to \n\t\tprotect this constitutional status and our right to govern our own \n\t\tlands?\ufffd Stephanie Spencer, Rincon tribal council member asked.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffdIndian gaming was meant to assure \n\t\tthat tribes become self-reliant and would no longer have to beg for \n\t\thandouts from the federal government, the state or taxpayers. To stand \n\t\ton our own feet and to generate the revenues that allow us to do for our \n\t\tcommunities what taxpayers take for granted from their local governments \n\t\tis what we sought to validate in this lawsuit. It\ufffds what we want for all \n\t\ttribal governments,\ufffd she explained.</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">\ufffd To this end,\ufffd Mazzetti added, \ufffdWe \n\t\thave requested that the governor\ufffds office commence negotiations in \n\t\tearnest to achieve the goals of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the \n\t\twishes of the citizens of California when they amended the state \n\t\tconstitution to allow casino gaming on tribal lands. If this \n\t\tadministration chooses, instead, to oppose us legally, we will continue \n\t\tto fight for tribal<br>\n\t\tsovereignty.\ufffd</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\">Symington Communications</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">back to top<font face=\"Times New Roman\">&#9650;</font></a></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"5\">\n\t\t<a name=\"Latino Film Fest\"></a>La Quincenera mas esperada de San Diego</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Escrito por Michelle Banuet</font></p>\n\t\t<table border=\"0\" width=\"98%\" id=\"table5\">\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td width=\"155\" valign=\"top\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Este \n\t\t\t\tpasado marzo 6 se llevo acabo la inaguracion del evento mas \n\t\t\t\tesperado El festival de cine latino en San Diego se viene \n\t\t\t\tpresentando desde hace 15 a\ufffdos, con gran \ufffdxito .</font></td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<img border=\"0\" src=\"images/latino_film_fest_2008.jpg\" width=\"179\" height=\"228\"></td>\n\t\t\t\t<td width=\"237\">\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Este ano es \n\t\t\t\tespecial ya que quince anos de de grandes logros y popularidad. \n\t\t\t\tya que se destaca por traer a las mejores celebridades de<br>\n\t\t\t\tLatino America, este ano no es la excepci\ufffdn ya que chequense la \n\t\t\t\tmadrinita que tuvo este gran evento nada mas y nada menos que la \n\t\t\t\tgran se\ufffdorona Carmen Salinas.</font></p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t</table>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Inagurando asi la gran \n\t\tnoche con grandes personalidades.

The 2003 survivor of the \n\t\tCedar wildfires has a powerful story to tell. Rudy came to be known as a \n\t\thero to many locals after the worst wildfire in California\ufffds history \n\t\tswept through San Diego\ufffds back-country. During the fires Rudy, placing \n\t\tthe safety of his family above his own, ensured they got to safety \n\t\tbefore leaving himself. </span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Reyes built his \n\t\tone bedroom home, only months before the fires, on his family\ufffds Wildcat \n\t\tCanyon Road lot. His house and his family\ufffds 5-bedroom home were among \n\t\tthe 2,300 homes destroyed in this fire. On October 26th 2003 Rudy was \n\t\tawakened by his sister to an orange glow and a warning that fire was \n\t\tmoving in rapidly. Realizing there was no chance to save the homes, Rudy \n\t\tmade sure his family members were safely in their vehicles before he \n\t\tleft.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">When Rudy \n\t\tattempted to drive out the air was so thick with smoke that his car \n\t\twould not start. Out of options, he doused himself in water, covered his \n\t\tface with his hands and prepared to run for his life. He ran one and a \n\t\thalf miles down the road through the wall of flames until reaching a \n\t\tneighbor in their vehicle. The neighbor drove him to the bottom of the \n\t\troad where an emergency crew was setup. With visible serious burn \n\t\tinjuries paramedics sedated him and he began his lengthy recovery.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">His recovery began \n\t\tat the UCSD Burn Center, where he remained unconscious for 2 months. His \n\t\trun through the wildfire burned him over approximately 70% of his body. \n\t\tHe lost his left ear, most of a finger, and was left temporarily blind \n\t\tby the flames.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Reyes\ufffd recovery \n\t\tinvolved 28 surgeries, including a new lasik procedure that brought his \n\t\tvision back. His recovery also included the use of medicinal marijuana, \n\t\tin the form of lotions and salves to heal his damaged skin. He also used \n\t\ta vaporizer in the hospital, which he cited as more effective pain \n\t\trelief than strongest pain drugs routinely prescribed. On March 4th \n\t\t2004, five months after the fire, he was the last burn victim released \n\t\tfrom hospital.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">The story of \n\t\tRudy\ufffds perseverance does not end after his release from hospital. Reyes \n\t\tstayed busy after his recovery. He earned a degree in Archaeology, and \n\t\tcontinued his teaching career, while helping organize the Barona \n\t\tCultural Center and Museum. His archaeological work is currently on \n\t\tdisplay at the El Cajon courthouse as the \ufffdBarona Photo Collection\ufffd.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Grateful to the \n\t\tcitizens of San Diego County who helped him and other burn survivors, \n\t\tRudy has decided to use his life to give back. His gift for sincere and \n\t\tarticulate speech, have made him an excellent spokesperson for \n\t\torganizations such as the Burn Institute and CHAD/United Way. He served \n\t\tas a mentor for young burn survivors for the Burn Institute, who \n\t\tdescribe him as \ufffdtruly an inspiration to those who have met him.\ufffd</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Four years after \n\t\tthe Cedar Fire, Wildcat Canyon Road was again part of the area effected \n\t\tby a massive back-country wildfire. The Witch Creek fire was one of \n\t\tmultiple fires that burned the county again. Witnessing many of the same \n\t\tproblems in this wildfire, Rudy is determined to take his public service \n\t\tto the next level. Dismayed by a lack of leadership from the County on \n\t\tthis issue he has decided to take matters in to his own hands, through a \n\t\tcampaign for the County Board of Supervisors.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Reyes points to \n\t\tdecisions by the board ending the program of inmates in County \n\t\tfacilities removing brush, their failure to create a unified fire \n\t\tauthority, as well as continuing to let development proceed in fire \n\t\tprone areas. The majority of San Diego \ufffds wildfire-prone areas are \n\t\twithin County Board of Supervisors, District 2. The seat currently \n\t\toccupied by Dianne Jacob. Reyes notes Jacob \ufffdhad fire trucks parked on \n\t\ther property\ufffd in Jamul during both wildfires, and has singled out some \n\t\tof her official positions for criticism.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">Two positions in \n\t\tparticular are irksome to Reyes, and to many of Jacob\ufffds constituents. \n\t\tHer delaying tactics in the creation of a county-wide fire authority, \n\t\tand her controversial vote in a 3-2 decision to sue the State of \n\t\tCalifornia \ufffds over the Compassionate Use Act, enacted in 1996. (Also \n\t\tknown as Proposition 215) Reyes notes the board has enough resources to \n\t\tfight a losing lawsuit to overturn State law, but not enough to continue \n\t\teffective fire prevention programs.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">He blasted the \n\t\tcounty \ufffdslush fund\ufffd which he says is doled out to groups each year \ufffdto \n\t\tmake sure nobody challenges them at election time\ufffd. The slush-fund was \n\t\tthe subject of a 2005 grand jury investigation which showed nearly $1 \n\t\tmillion in missing receipts in the 7 years since the program\ufffds \n\t\tinception.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">At the time Jacob \n\t\tadmitted the program had shoddy book-keeping but pointed to the \n\t\tslush-fund as evidence of the county\ufffds health saying, and as she stated \n\t\tto the North County Times: \ufffdBecause county government is healthy, stable \n\t\tand well-managed, we have an opportunity to re-invest tax dollars back \n\t\tinto the community.\ufffd</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">The secretive \n\t\tgrant program gives each county\ufffds supervisor up to $2 million a year \n\t\tfrom the county\ufffds general fund. They are able to distribute this money \n\t\tto projects and non-profit groups as they wish with no written policy. \n\t\tUp against that kind of money and a 16-year incumbency, Rudy shows the \n\t\tsame determination that has come to define his public life as a burn \n\t\tsurvivor.</span></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n\t\t<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\">\ufffdThey have all \n\t\tbeen there long enough and it is time for a change.\ufffd Says Reyes \n\t\treferring to the five supervisors who have sat together uninterrupted \n\t\tfor more than a decade.</span></p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman\">Visit \n\t\tRudy\ufffds campaign website at <b>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single\" href=\"http://www.reyes4supervisor.com/\">\n\t\twww.Reyes4Supervisor.com</a></b></span><p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">\n\t\tback to top<font face=\"Times New Roman\">&#9650;</font></a></p>\n\t\t<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><font size=\"6\">\n\t\t<a name=\"Harry Reid Story\"></a>Harry Reid Story- <br>\n\t\t</font><font size=\"4\">the man who is now U.S. Senate Majority Leader \n\t\tHarry Reid</font></p>\n\t\t<table border=\"0\" width=\"98%\" id=\"table7\">\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td width=\"334\">\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t<img border=\"0\" src=\"images/reid_zorn.jpg\" width=\"253\" height=\"260\"><br>\n\t\t\t\tHarry Reid and Z.

Moulin Rouge is an important part \n\t\t\t\tof African American history here in Las Vegas. MRDC assures \n\t\t\t\tanxious residents in the area that the redevelopment of the \n\t\t\t\tMoulin Rouge is for them; to provide jobs and economic \n\t\t\t\tstability, but without Uptown residents support this can be a \n\t\t\t\tquite difficult endeavor.</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t</table>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;As a Las Vegas resident the Moulin Rouge has been \n\t\ta mystery with little or no information released to the public. In April \n\t\t2008 MRDC changed that with an open house to explain just what it is \n\t\ttheir doing. And when I say they, let\ufffds specify. Ed Vance and \n\t\tAssociates, Stan Wickerson, Alan Glover just to name a few \ufffdEd Vance has \n\t\tbeen on this project from day one\ufffd explained Dale Scott CEO of MRDC, \n\t\t\ufffdand is relentless in his vision to see redevelopment in this part of \n\t\ttown.\ufffd </p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\">Republic Urban Properties has also stepped up to the \n\t\tplate to see this project followed through. MRDC and Partners aims to \n\t\tplease all, residents and tourists alike. April 2nd MRDC will brave City \n\t\tHall to see if they can stick to the plan of breaking ground early next \n\t\tyear. Alan Glover (MRDC partner) expressed in a phone conversation the \n\t\tgreat effect the project will have on Downtown and the extension of the \n\t\tmetropolis stretching all the way to the Moulin Rouge. How excited \n\t\tUptown Las Vegas is to have the Moulin Rouge redeveloped! With seventeen \n\t\tacre\ufffds to work with don\ufffdt be surprised if the Moulin Rouge is the \n\t\tgrandest hotel in Uptown Las Vegas! Or maybe as expressed by MRDC that \n\t\tif all goes well they could also provide housing as well to the \n\t\tresidents of Uptown Las Vegas in the future.</p>\n\t\t<p align=\"left\">The sky\ufffds the limit! Remember Ward 5 residents Moulin \n\t\tRouge Development<br>\n\t\tCorporation needs your support. If it wasn\ufffdt for the Moulin Rouge \n\t\tsegregation<br>\n\t\tmight still be present in Las Vegas.

(Plan for a Safer Oakland \n\t\tis a community coalition started by All of Us or None and Critical \n\t\tResistance.) On April 1, over 100 folks showed up to the speakout \n\t\tincluding crews from the Center for Young Women's Development (CYWD), \n\t\tUnited Playaz (UP), Destiny Arts/Silence the Violence (STV), Trunk Boiz \n\t\tcrew, Intertribal Friendship House, and more. The speakout included \n\t\ttestimonies from a range of folks about their efforts to get a job after \n\t\tbeing released from prison. A lot of performers also did spoken word<br>\n\t\tand music at the rally: an American Indian Movement drumming circle \n\t\tblessed the gathering, and there were also performances by: Randy from \n\t\tYouth Against Youth Incarceration, D.Nok, Trinidad, and STV/Destiny Arts \n\t\tyouth, Trunk Boiz, and the Brass Liberation Orchestra.</p>\n\t\t<p>All three points from the PSO platform were presented: 1) Welcome \n\t\tfolks<br>\n\t\thome from prison: Ban the Box in Oakland City hiring, repeal the curfew<br>\n\t\tfor people on parole and probation, fund more re-entry services. 2) \n\t\tInvest in People, not policing and prisons: stop Operation Impact, \n\t\tre-affirm Oakland as a Sanctuary city, stop Oakland police collaboration \n\t\twith ICE (Immigration and Customs enforcement), stop using Three Strikes \n\t\tin Oakland prosecutions. 3) Stand Up for Oakland Youth: no more Oakland \n\t\tyouth to CYA, keep Oakland\ufffds schools open, implement the Bill of Rights \n\t\tfor Children of Incarcerated Parents</p>\n\t\t<p>We also got a lot of media coverage! The event/issue was on the front \n\t\tpage of the Bay Area section of the SF Chronicle on Wednesday. KQED and \n\t\tTelemundo also covered the speakout, and several radio shows covered the \n\t\tevent. Leading up to the event, we did a lot of outreach around Ban the \n\t\tBox throughout Oakland, circulated petitions, and collected endorsements \n\t\tfrom individuals and organizations that were faxed to the mayor's \n\t\toffice.</p>\n\t\t<p>As a result of all of this, by May 31 the City Administrator has \n\t\tagreed to<br>\n\t\tevaluate which Public Works jobs will no longer require disclosure of an \n\t\tapplicant\ufffds conviction history. Once again we learned that bureaucracies \n\t\trespond best to mass mobilizations that DEMAND OUR RIGHTS.</p>\n\t\t<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">back to top<font face=\"Times New Roman\">&#9650;</font></a></p>\n\t\t<p>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t<td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">&nbsp;<i><font size=\"2\"> </font>\n\t\t<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Read Indian Voices in PDF format:</font></i><p align=\"center\">\n\t\t<b><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.californiaindianeducation.org/educational_news/indian_voices/2008/IV_Spring_2008-6.pdf\">Spring \n\t\t2008 Indian Voices PDF </a></font></b></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Arial\"><b><font size=\"2\">\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.californiaindianeducation.org/educational_news/indian_voices/2008/spring_2008_6dbltrk.pdf\">\n\t\tSpring 2008 IV center-fold PDF</a></font></b><br>\n&nbsp;</font></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p><b><font face=\"Arial Narrow\">GuideToOnlineSchools.com can help you find an <a href=http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/>accredited distance learning degree</a> in <a href=http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/esl_bilingual_tesol.html>ESL</a> and <a href=http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/esl_bilingual_tesol.html>TESOL</a> at one of many prestigious schools, like  <a href=http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/universityofphoenix.html>University of Phoenix</a> so you can start a career <a href=http://education.qld.gov.au/library/services/tesol.html>teaching English</a> as a second language.</font></b></p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p align=\"center\"><b>Affordable Senior Apartments</b></p>\n\t\t<p align=\"center\">Lovely 100-unit senior apartment building will soon \n\t\thave apartments available.&nbsp; Must be 62 or older or mobility \n\t\timpaired.
